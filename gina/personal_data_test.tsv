INTP	 me too . but my fantasy's mostly revolve around a story and not myself .

INFP	 i only wear make up because i know it makes others view me more favourably and that does actually matter in my job and it might help in other situations too . otherwise i really couldn't care less .

[SEP] don't waste your attention on those who give you nothing back . save your attention and care for those who also give it back to you . [SEP] i totally agree . one of our university's libraries was renewed a while ago and it looks like a clinic now . there's a lot of empty space, everything is white and there's very little any actual . . . [SEP] i prefer libraries over bookstores, because they're more silent and the books are free . also the smelly degenerates bring a nice down-to-earth vibe to it .

INFP	 i think you can be a loner and still be quite functional and psychologically normal . i've always considered myself a loner at heart . i just like my own company, surrounded by books, music, good . . .

INTP	read the book, but didn't see the movie . but i really wanted to because, if i remember correctly, broken social scene created the soundtrack and i love them so hard it hurts . [SEP] __URL__ say yes . i find the thought of continuous travel, self reliance, interaction with various cultures and peoples, and finding ways to live off the land to be very appealing . when asked by . . . [SEP] @luxurieux, @misstheground, @kilgore trout oh dear, i hope i haven't unwittingly started a battle royale for my affections . . . *waits expectantly* [SEP] it depends on the message, for me . while i may not agree with all their points i hold artists who call pressing issues to light in higher regard than those who only rap about drugs, money, and sex . . . . [SEP] i believe that suffering is the only way a person can truly grow, though there is a point where it's no longer beneficial . everything in moderation . i picked up quite a bit of nietzsche this past . . .

[SEP] yes, we do that often, but that seeking approval attitude, comes from us being unsure of what the other person we want to interact with thinks and we are just testing the waters . we actually put . . . [SEP] hey orange . . . yea that is so true about us ! we love taking the initiative . . however, if the favor is not returned in kind, we feel as if we have been taken for granted and not treated well, and would . . .

[SEP] used to . it's no point beating yourself up over things u cannot control nor change . [SEP] welcome [SEP] no [SEP] infj . . .

[SEP] we open them on christmas day, when we wake up : ) [SEP] hahahaha ! ! ! good for u ! ! better than nothing : p [SEP] this is not paranormal . i said i don't believe in paranormal and super powers and bla bla . i don't think that being intuitive means u have a super power . yes, some ppl are more sensitive , intuitive . . . 
INFJ	 jinsei txs : ) i find ur avatar intriguing . and interesting . [SEP] do not attack anybody dear to me, or it may the last thing you will remember do not play cocky or fake with me ! i will make you cry ! other than that we can be civil . lol [SEP] another lost cause yes and no . there's no perfection . so if ideal means perfect . . . yup, they don't exist ! lol for me ideal is a combination of favourite, preferable traits, combined with . . .

[SEP] yes, absolutely ! i've done lots of self search and splitting of the hairs, goings far as doubting all my values and principles, trying to prove them wrong . but in the end i am who i am . i've been . . . [SEP] oliveanderson hmmm, i've been where u are . and i'm not even close to enfp but being and infj i would try to disappear from the friends circle for awhile . you know, give it a rest, so to speak . . . . [SEP] mony i really agree . [SEP] well, yeah i know i'm difficult and have high expectations . can't help it . because if i lowered the standards i wouldn't be true to myself . in fact i've gone thru different phases . first i tried . . . [SEP] hahahahaha ur too much fun !

[SEP]  : ) quite the topic lol here's my other 2c : don't worry about it . infj and enfp have a natural, organic attraction . don't feel pressured into anything . yeah, i like smart ppl, but ur smart may be . . . [SEP] jinsei & kiawaki it's a very interesting read and i think both views are valid . just different timing . for instance in my own experience, i applied jinsei's advice long ago and for many years . . . 
ISFP	 yes . i teach high school and have to be a leader for my students . it isn't a natural role for me, and my first 3 years of teaching were brutal . it took a while and i had to learn the skills needed to . . . [SEP] i'm 27-- once or twice a week . with small groups of friends and/or coworkers . i hover between i/e though . when i was younger, i went out less . i'm becoming more extroverted with age, possibly because . . . [SEP] i only have one friend who is an istj . we get along well because we enjoy doing a lot of the same stuff . he wanted to date me for the longest time before realizing it just wouldn't work, ahaha . . . he . . . [SEP]  . [SEP] when people are on their phones while with company . to me this says i'd much rather talk to the people on my phone versus talking with the people who are actually present . my friends are actually . . .

[SEP] that sounds a lot like me . when i really have strong feelings for someone, my actions are determined by whether or not i sense they feel the same way about me . if i sense that it is unrequited, i . . . [SEP] it depends on the situation and how comfortable i am with the other people . for example, at my schools holiday staff party, i stayed mostly quiet . it's not that i'm not participating, i just prefer . . . [SEP] usually yes, it depends on what is done . if a so ever becomes physically abusive or cheats on me, he's gone . no second chances . i'm not enabling those choices . for arguments, those are simple, i give . . . [SEP] usually when out and about with friends, i dress like a hippie with fair trade colorful things like agan traders and global mamas . . . but, this is my typical wear now, since i spend most of my day . . . [SEP] i've dated two istp's . one when i was very young ( 19 ) and it didn't work out because i was too emotionally immature and needed someone who could validate my feelings . i was insecure, and he was not . . . [SEP] possibly intp tmlt skip/frolic in public . [SEP] i like anything that tells a good story and makes me feel something . i've just finished reading a few books by sherman alexie, which i loved because his writing made me laugh and cry at the same . . . 
INTP	 philosophy, biology and psychology are my main interests . if it wasn't for the lack of high-paying jobs i'd definitely go for philosophy as a career . i like dealing with the human mind and . . . [SEP] i was going to choose sesshomaru, but people would keep staring at me all the time . i guess we should pick characters with an ordinary look . silver hair, claws and golden eyes wouldn't fit in our . . . [SEP] for power : goku for personality and intelligence : shikamaru from naruto for looks ( and intelligence and power as well ) : aizen from bleach i guess i'd pick aizen . aizen is awesome . also, kyoka . . . [SEP] let the right one in . [SEP] oh yes . i have only bad things to say about myself . that makes self-depreciating humor so natural to me . bitter sarcasm ? there's no way i could live my life seeing all the shit that people do . . . [SEP] he's lonely . he saw other people having fun while he was alone with his friend . he wanted to interrupt their fun and be the super macho so he would feel more secure about himself . some people are . . . [SEP] my heart tells me to pick charmander because he's my favorite, but i'm pretty sure that his tail would eventually start a fire . squirtle would be the perfect choice for hot days when i'm thirsty . . . . [SEP] to prove he's so powerful . but seriously, we are not alone in this universe . everything points out to the fact that there's life out there so the universe has to be big . the real question is : if god . . . [SEP] romantically ? i would run away in pain . one day i was browsing porn and there was this porn actress that looked just like my ex . i spent the next 8 hours feeling like shit . but if said person . . . [SEP] amateur porn . i love amateur pornography . i can't deal with fake porn . like those asian girls faking all that moaning . that kills the vibe for me . i like it when they're not pretending . [SEP] my iq is 135, almost a genius . i don't know how to use all that potential though . i'm too lazy to do anything . i'm too lazy to even care about anything . if at least being gifted meant that i'd have a . . . [SEP] parties ? i hate them . social gathering ? only when there's only people that i know and that i like there . i only go to this kind of things when i have a escape plan . if i can't escape to recharge . . . 
ISTP	 we are both eighteen-years-old . may i ask why you have doubts that he is an entp ? for the longest time, i thought that he must have been an estp because of how physical he tends to be, but after . . . [SEP] the friends that we share really aren't of any help . i don't like to let anyone know about my feelings for him, and everyone is always teasing us, thinking that we are seeing each other . i wouldn't . . . [SEP] well i suppose that may help, haha . my apologies . i am still uncertain about what my personality type may be . i know that i am a sensor ( the se function is most recognizable to me ) , and i am an . . .

[SEP] 0 . is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions ? for example, a stressful time, mental illness, medications, special life circumstances ? other useful information includes sex, . . . [SEP] ah, gotcha . i don't think being anonymous would really help solve anything though . . . but thank you for your input . enneagram 6 is a bitch . [SEP] why should i care in the first place what anyone thinks of me ? i can't create another account, or else i will be banned, for one thing . and i shouldn't be bothered with the thoughts others might have . . . [SEP] perhaps i may be an introvert, because even though i genuinely enjoy the company of others and meeting/talking to people, i often find myself feeling rather exhausted by the end of the day . however, . . . [SEP] this is my second attempt to figure out just what type i may be . when asking this before, the results i was given were isfj and and infj, both which recieved the reaction of huh ! ? anyway . if . . . [SEP] i think you already know what it means . [SEP] oh yeah, especially if you have used your dominant function way too often, it can really drain you out - it really is healthy to focus more on your other functions ! mmm, i don't think this is so . . . [SEP] while i think it is rather admirable that you want to expand more on your shadow function, to develop and use it more often, i think the process of trying to do so will definitely take a toll on you, . . . 
INFJ	i think this is a good start . both infj and enfp are quite selfless into giving others their need . however, the obvious difference here under the heading of being selfless is that ; a . the . . . [SEP] usually i have a strong preference of listening to sad songs and let melancholy sinks in whenever i feel the blue is hitting me . however, one exception is this song : if i rule the world by . . . [SEP] i remembered an intj poster posted this from intjforum and found it quite helpful to distinguish the difference when i first discovered mbti . here it is : fe is the lava that boils out . fi is . . . [SEP] the word bitter comes from the ancient greek--meaning sharp or pointed . and as anyone who has been on the receiving end of a bitter person with a penchant for 'sharp-tongued' remarks knows, . . . [SEP] trying too hard to re-capture all of the scenes in my dreams and what i had felt from it ( especially if they are inexplicably eccentric ) --by typing out all of the vivid details on my smartphone . . . . [SEP] perhaps you've been jumping into conclusion too soon with your sugar-mushy-ne ? i've often found some enfps do have a very strong 'gut' feelings via their hypersensitive-ne, and along with their . . . [SEP] tough love was originally intended for adult drug addicts, not for general people still learning/going through hardships about life . more importantly, tough love used by parents at the mall for . . . [SEP] i just thought of sharing these questions with perc members ( originally drafted for an ice-breaking activity from one of my esl class ) . any takers ? 1 . how old would you be if you didnx92t . . . [SEP] this actually reminds me of this quote by lars h . svendsen's from a philosophy of boredom : a utopia cannot, by definition, include boredom, but the 'utopia' we are living in is boring . [SEP] to be honest, there's nothing that you can do to make her feel better about herself on her own . i think for being a judger as an infj, we will just keep comparing with our close circle of friends . . . 
ENTP	 naked economics is bone dry [SEP] sagittarius for sure . [SEP] i think curved roads in straight lines ; it gets me nowhere . [SEP] agnostic because i don't care . [SEP] @op it makes a lot of sense to me . it's usually s types who bother to describe their crazy dreams . n types will tell me only if i occur in one of their dreams and how, i assume in order to imply it . . . [SEP] you're converting me . [SEP] i'm 18 and got a sales position at the mall . no previous experience . yeah yeah ! [SEP] it was not only the lack of arrogance, but the lack of humor or tangents or whim, pos or neg, that led me to an infj conclusion . an entp under the age of like 45 would be offended that people were so . . . [SEP] i think we shine in our keen understanding of reality . inxx space cadets may score better on iq and math and other useless tests, but trust theory and their own minds more than they trust reality . . . . [SEP] i had a 3 . 4 . my senior year was so bad, i brought it down to a 3 . 3/3 . 2 . i don't even know . i don't care . ( it's because i can't write anything longer than a paragraph . ) i'm not going to college this . . . [SEP] heells no ! [SEP] hell yeah . lemon grass and flintstone birth control here . *inhales* [SEP] excellent visual . 
INTJ	 i'm sensing you are the kind of woman who strikes up conversations with spiders and tries to make them feel safe before you have your way with them . [SEP] wow, you are practically a serial killer . bodies all over your apartment, i am guessing . : ) [SEP] you are luckier than most because you at least know her reasons for not wanting you ( initially ) . i would start following through on your career goals and taking them seriously . at the same time, . . . [SEP] those are constructive ideas, thanks . : ) if we linked to an outside dating profile, there still should be a section where those are posted . a single thread would get busy over time . i'm not sure . . . [SEP] it's true on every dating forum that someone can lie about important characteristics . fat women can say they are skinny . old men can say they are young . young women can say they are older . that's not . . . [SEP] who cares if the forum is derided by other forums ? why is that important ? are we a bunch of 13 year old girls who need to evaluate our status based on gossip put out by other 13 year girls ? my . . . [SEP] many people who say they are not single are in fact single . they simply don't want to be contacted, so they lie . and - by the way - some people are in open relationships and want contacts in spite . . . [SEP] i haven't seen that either, and i doubt i would ever participate in that even if i did see it . it's not a substitute for someone saying : 1 ) i am available and interested in meeting people 2 ) . . . [SEP] that actually misses the entire point of the feature . most people on this site are taken : either married or in a committed relationship . the point of a section like a dating section is to let people . . . [SEP] can you tell us what the questions you asked this intj were ? that might give us some clue about whether they were ordinary or not . as an intj, i would say in general that i have some threshold of . . . [SEP] there's always being a webcam girl, so you could lay back in total relaxation and talk to desperate men about politics and whatever else strikes your fancy . [SEP] porn stars have greatly reduced lifespans, even excluding the ones who die from drug overdose and violent causes . it's probably all of those bacteria and viruses from a gazillion fluid exchanges . . . . 
INTP	 ok, before all the pearls of wisdom are added here, i just wanted to insert that the pic was a selfie just after i donated 10 inches of hair to make wigs for kids with cancer . now go . . . . [SEP] tall enough gravity is a bitch after 40 . [SEP] i have had 2 past relationships that fall into that category . they were long term and i truly loved the people i just realized it wasn't going to work . i still miss aspects of those relationships . . . . [SEP] it's not my normal mechanics . maybe when i was young but as i got older it took me longer and longer to get over each relationship after a break up . i'm over the person and realize i did the right . . . [SEP] oh yeah that helps all my complexes . so now i'm an old tall psychopath who attracts young fellas into fetish sex . : tongue : [SEP] ha ! i thought the lack of guys hitting on me was because i was tall . i didn't realize i looked like a psychopath . but alas, i'm old enough to be your mother so i'm going to have to decline . [SEP] __URL__ would you be likely to read into paranormal phenomena ( or any unproven phenomena ) and cross analyze it in your mind with other responses and evidence ? i'd be unlikely to read into paranormal . . .

[SEP] why i would never date based on mbti do they just post to reaffirm themselves, or what ? they read the title, instantly react, and leave a passing statement without ever trying to truly understand . . . [SEP] you should always be seeking a woman out who is healthy and comfortable in her type ( regardless of whether or not they know it ) . relationships between thinkers and feelers can work just fine, . . . [SEP] three words : the ultimate sacrifice . [SEP] debates . just stop talking and believe what you want, already . . . no one is going to change their minds, not on this planet . [SEP] maybe . . . or maybe you're a bioghost : d . . . couldn't help it > . < [SEP] i'm going to go out on a limb and assume you haven't ready anything the authors of mbti wrote about it . . . like that it's dynamic, no one will fit their type 100%, and that you learn more about it in . . . [SEP] esjs in general, lol .

INFP	my impression after watching these two videos is inxj, however i don't feel like i have enough information to do any sort of detailed analysis . [SEP] why do you feel unsafe ?

INFP	 haha, yeah, that's a good summary of shameless nation's and my discussion . i was mostly just speaking up, because shameless nation made it sound like all infps would rather stay in their . . . [SEP] most similar ideas are generalizations ? i'm not sure what that means . yeah, we're definitely focusing on different parts of infp descriptions because of our different values . i do not want to be . . . [SEP] right, i wasn't saying that evaluations of success aren't subjective . what you wrote implied a fundamental difference in how an infp and an entj would evaluate success--that's what i disagree with . . . . [SEP] hmm . . . i still don't agree . i think that goals can definitely overlap, even if the way infps and entjs approach a problem can look very different . additionally, if a person can look outside of their . . . [SEP] i actually completely disagree with this ! i think, yes, i enjoy the process/journey more than the entjs i know . they can often be more focused on getting quickly to a goal ( it's nice though that the . . .

ENTJ	 conclusion intj - i didn't feel like i needed to respond since vive has already presented my view .

[SEP] no [SEP] i have to say that the opposite of intp in cognitive functions is not intj it's isfp . and by behavior it's probably esfj opposing attitudes might be hard to grasp but can lead to the same . . . [SEP] i disagree i am seeing infj in fact you seem to be a very strong ni, maybe too strong, if you see a better idea but don't want to change it's probably because you don't want to go through the mental . . .

[SEP] that's a perfect example of te ! fe types often feel that way about things like taste because they are making value judgments in an external and objective way and that's the way you make logical, . . .

[SEP] yeah, enfp seemed really fitting : ) but it's nice to have an mbti and an enneagram type because they can cover different aspects of your personality . [SEP] you're very welcome ! i don't think the test at humanmetrics takes cognitive functions into account, so it might mistype a little bit for that reason . it isn't at all uncommon for judging types . . . [SEP] that suggests te, which is what i was thinking : d [SEP] might be a type 5 thing instead of ti . your full enneagram will consist of three of the types so it might be something like 9w8 7w6 5w4 .

INFP	i was wondering as an infp how do you react to 'likes' ? when you post content do hope that people will 'like' your responses ? or, do you feel indifferent ? perhaps, you dislike 'likes' altogether ? . . .

INFJ	 korvyna thanks so much !
