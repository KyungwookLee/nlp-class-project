[SEP] i really liked this article . does it describe si pretty well ? introverted sensing / sensation ( si ) [SEP] as several people have said on this thread, there is a tendency in mbti descriptions to label intuition as being creative, and hence sensing as uncreative . i was curious as to the validity of this . . .

[SEP] well, you created patterns in you head, so yes . but if you mean that pattern based thinking isn't necessarily creative, then i agree . an intuitive can spend their time focusing on patterns that have . . . [SEP] i like it . now that's interesting . intelligence to me seems to come from creativity, not vice versa . but i can see it both ways . [SEP] i'm asking whether your creativity goes against your sensing nature, or with it . so would you say, i'm creative even though i'm a sensor or i'm creative because i'm a sensor ?

INTJ	when your most common response to hey *name*, what's up ? is yeah, sure [SEP] we introverts tend to be less extreme than the extroverts, because ijs, despite being judgers, are percieving dominants and ips are judging dominants, even though the functions are introverted . : ) [SEP] i don't see how that's a judger thing . . . probably an introvert thing, if anything . especially intuitive ones .

INTP	 testing avatar and signature edit : working as intended . carry on folks . [SEP] yup the definition of intelligence is debatable and so any study that doesn't address the variations surrounding this is superficial as shit . this is something i discover with the help of the perc . . . [SEP] lol yes i can so imagine that . [SEP] i think so . funny how in reality there are so much more sensors than intuitives but here it's reversed . these statistics hardly has any meaning beyond the perc community . [SEP] nts and nf are most active here and they have good respect for each other and hence explain the statistics .

[SEP] don't really have favorites . i would ideally like to be more judging and less perceiving . and a little more extroverted than introverted . but these adjustments can be made over time . overall however . . . [SEP] i do think i'm superior at pushing logics in general, because that's what nts do, and naturally we come off as superior in a logical debate . i also think i'm vastly inferior in socialising with . . .

[SEP] i saw the movie and from what i remember basically everyone was istp ( except for the bishop guy was esfp ) : tongue : [SEP] yeah if you want a good example of a j, look at papania especially in the last episodes ( probably an istj ) . i was actually kind of bummed that cohle ( somewhat ) changed in the end ; not that i agreed . . . 
INFP	 i'm sorry but that's a really stupid statement and shows how little understanding you have of the functions . feelers can be extremely evil and manipulative and insensitive to others . in fact, . . . [SEP] he's like the polar opposite of an istj . doesn't stick to traditions, does what he wants and doesn't consider others, doesn't value rules or traditions .

[SEP] i'm leaning towards isfp since alot of your facts jump out as sensing to me . what are you like when you're stressed ? do you tend to lash out and become agressive or are you cold and calculating ? [SEP] i lie to people who are too nosy . i have to rehearse the lie before i tell it though .

INFP	 ridding yourself of your personality ? i don't think you could take a less healthy approach toward your development as an individual . you're only going to feel comfortable if you first embrace those . . .

[SEP] sparky major fail on this one [SEP] owfin, so she trusts in things that are not actually facts, but that she accepts as facts . hmm . . . [SEP] @vanderlyle, so everything printed in a book is fact ? and i did not say what you quoted regarding perfectionism . that is somewhat dishonest to misquote me . [SEP] that's because she is a dominant thinker . that doesn't actually have much to do with being an istj . how come she is the only one who figures it out and believes it ? [SEP] but death of the author is the correct way to analyze . otherwise we wind up with idiotic things like gay dumbledores and such, that are not actually mentioned in the text whatsoever . istjs . . . 
ENFJ	 yes, unfortunately it is . it is a kind of damned if you do and damned if you do not situation . either you get overlooked or you get told you are too aggressive for behaviour that would be accepted, . . .

[SEP] yes, i am ambitious, to get approval from people that matter . i want people to approve of me, to be proud for me, to think i do well . i am not ambitious in the sense that i want to have lots of . . .

[SEP] i have an excellent memory for the most unimportant things, but i cannot for the life of me fit faces with names . i know the faces, i know the names, but i have a really hard time to identify that . . . [SEP] enfj can choose careers because somebody with a strong influence favours that career and they do not want to disappoint . but having said that : in my experience college majors have not much to do with . . . [SEP] one more point : when i took the test it said very clearly that you are the best judge of your character, so if you are that uncomfortable with the result ( and have tested enfj before ) i would go with . . . [SEP] good luck ! i have been studying both chinese and japanese and the moment you stop actively learning and/or using the characters they are gone, so keep at it ! let us now how your test turns out .

INTJ	 heck no . the more girly and extraverted you are, the more feminine you seem . true, but at the same time all the real housekeepers are sensors . . . . i personally find sensing to be more feminine . . . [SEP] true but if you have to make a priority it needs to be humans . . . [SEP] it depends on the interaction . if it is positive and i am content and included, then yes, i am stimulated . but when it's negative and i am ignored or in an uncomfortable situation i am very drained . [SEP] this one thought has been on my mind for a few days, and i think i've come to my conclusion for now : if i could change one thing in the world, what would it be ? the most popular choice i've heard . . . [SEP] woah, all of the above sounds a lot like me . . . it's not necessarily apparent to others who don't know me very well when i'm stressed, though, i just freeze up and look threatening . : kitteh : [SEP] hahaha brilliant ! i have hardwood floors too, and i used to do that all . the . time . freakishly fun . [SEP] that looks very interesting ! by the way, i couldn't help but ask what type of camera you took these pics with xd [SEP] actually i kind of like vampires . . . [SEP] estj, or some es-type, but personally i'm attracted as hell to intps . ^^ they draw me like ants to honey . [SEP] it's not a physical tiredness, more like a mental weariness that i think comes from describing to others the brilliancy going on in our brains ; - ) however, i've been able to stem the weary flow by . . . [SEP] what's your idea of a pulse ? sexual tensity ? and grabbing the dick idea won't work, but thanks for the thought . maybe that'll work down the road . ; ) [SEP] hahaha, i got the j- felt really weird putting my hands behind me with my eyes closed and wondered what the neighbors would think xd abstract me .

[SEP] i'd say that, generally speaking, you're right . we aren't a first choice for anyone, but then, most types aren't . there isn't any big demand for curmudgeonly istjs, floaty infps, or chug-and-blow . . . [SEP] fe is really the way we interact with the world, because introverted intuition is so personal to us . after all, it's a unique view of the world that's privy to us and us alone . so ni really does us . . .

ISTJ	 i'm 39 now, and i was probably about 30 when i took my first online mbti test . i've always tested as an istj, though i only started getting more interested in it ( and how istjs relate to other types ) . . .

[SEP] i can count the number of sick days i've taken in the last 18 years on two fingers, and i had perfect attendance every quarter when i went back to school for another degree a couple of years ago . . . . [SEP] i agree with the others that istjs have a deep obsessive streak . i get deeply into the minutia of things that pique my interest . once i feel like i've learned everything i can about something, . . . [SEP] sounds pretty normal for an older istj to me . we really like our time at home . it's our haven from the world . i think that quote a man's home is his castle was probably coined for an istj . [SEP] do you carve out time for you to take care of you, emotionally and physically ? yes . . . . as an introvert who has the luxury ( or misfortune, depending on your perspective ) of living alone, i have . . . [SEP] indeed, but i've never seen anything like this on a mbti website . psychological type profiles pure mumbo-jumbo . edited to add : when i call it mumbo-jumbo, i'm referring to the physical . . .

[SEP] for those who don't know, the socionics types are slightly different from the mbti types, so using your mbti type there might be misleading . i personally find socionics to be about as believable . . .

INFP	 i did read that a while ago actually . but despite my love of quoting things, i'm pretty bad at taking in information i read : tongue : . yes i should have known this . i always tend to focus too . . . [SEP] and these origins are pretty ancient . the words artisan ( sps ) , guardian ( sjs ) , idealist ( nfs ) and rational ( nts ) are translations of plato's types from 340 b . c . [SEP] this was written by david keirsey : myers's e-i scale is badly flawed because she inherited jung's error of confusing extraversion with observation ( s ) and introversion with introspection ( n ) [SEP] this has actually been really hard for me to work out . when i take tests that measure my preferred functions, fi and ni are always equally my dominant ones . it seems that it's only because my ne is . . . [SEP] i think keirsey's idea was that these pairings are the most 'useful' to each other . for example, the entj can give clear direction to an infp's 'cause' . i'd imagine ( and kind of hope ) that the . . . [SEP] david keirsey mentioned that we have different 'values' . for 'seeking' he said that : sjs seek security sps seek stimulation nfs seek identity nts seek knowledge and for 'yearning' he said : . . . [SEP] actually i think the main problem is that it has been written by someone else . if it had been an autobiography ( as opposed to a biography ) , then you would have a good point about him being . . . [SEP] myers wrote in a preface to 'gifts differing' that her mother ( briggs ) was infj, and that she used her introverted intuition as insight into the meaning of type . [SEP] i don't know about jung, but isabel myers was infp and katharine briggs was infj ( according to myers herself ) [SEP] i understand everything you've said apart from this : if you imagine someone without any intuition at all ( obviously no people like this exist, but just to help explain ) . 'theory' would be a . . . [SEP] you're right, i didn't take that into account . but i think treebob implied that sensing can be used in a discussion of theory, so i'd like to know how this is possible . [SEP] i don't see how sensing can be used in a discussion of theory . surely a sensing type still has to use intuition to even know what a theory is ? i agree with this, but i meant that sensing . . .

[SEP] i can agree with that, at the end of your statement we hide behind our intuition, finding truth in people before we reveal our true self . do you really believe we can fully open up ?

[SEP] i'm either 358 or 385, though in which stacking to me is a somewhat arbitrary distinction to make as i believe that the core indicates primary motivation and has a hand in every action . therefore, a . . .

[SEP] 2% still means about 1/50 people . i've probably seen 1-2 others today . i never understood fascination by virtue of rarity . [SEP] so, you're on the esfj train also, right ? [SEP] i have toyed with the idea of the op being an extrovert also for awhile now, actually . after many conversations with him, however i'm disinclined to believe it due to op being much too close with fi . . .

[SEP] my favorite explanation for anything when dealing with sensors is it's just a paradigm shift, nothing fancy . i honestly have no idea what a paradigm shift is, nor do i care, but it seems to satisfy . . .

[SEP] oh . . . . you meant those kinds of beverages . in that case . . . . no . but if we open the discussion to involve adult beverages, most definitely . sake makes me friggin brilliant . [SEP] cliche, yes, but hawaii . probably maui or kuaui, for the beaches and the readily available solitude . also, they hate work and clothes, with which i am totally in agreement . choice two, a boat . . . . [SEP] i can't think of the last time i thought of or called a person cool . i use it more just to mean okay, as in, that's cool, i'm fine with it . when i think of people being cool i think of the older . . .

[SEP] ^i'm not sure what you intended to mean by this, but if you are implying that evolution made intuition more favorable and thus common in the population over time, i find that problematic in a few . . . [SEP] functions used by each type, in order of dominance : infj : ni fe ti se intj : ni te fi se intp : ti ne si fe fe-ti are one pair ; te-fi are another pair . you cannot mix and match between these two . . .

[SEP] i know it's just meaningless internet points, but it's bothering me how inaccurate the numbers are . also, i want to get rid of this progress bar . [SEP] wondering if my post count will ever go back to normal . [SEP] terribly bored, no perspective of what to do today .

[SEP] i'm familiar with wrpg style, it's just i don't like sticking with one character throughout the game . that's why i prefer group-style or crpgs, but crpgs are story based and not really action based . . . [SEP] i never thought of jrpgs like that, and that's very true about wrpgs like tes and fallout series . i unfortunately, don't own a playstation console or a ( x ) ds family handheld system, i manly use steam . . .

[SEP] oh yeah, especially the walking dead the first season from telltale, but after that, it just seems more about the gameplay than the story itself . i mean know that it's not truly choose your own . . . [SEP] that's right, but what you do when you don't have the complete set ? should i just play sims 3 knowing i won't have the complete edition any time soon ?

ENFJ	 i think you should re-read what i said again . i don't think he's trying to blame you by using your mbti type against you, i think he's trying to tell you that he responds better to an emotional . . . [SEP] i think several people in here have given some good advice, so i'd like to back some of it up and maybe offer a bit of my own . jakedk is right that you need to give him a bit of space . if he's . . .

[SEP] funny you mention that -- that's often how i feel in a relationship . it ends up becoming a self fulfilling prophecy though if you focus on it . trust me . [SEP] i don't really think there's a trick to 'attracting' us -- i suppose you either come across one or you don't . you need to be a good judge of personality type and try to see if he's a like enfj . it's . . .

[SEP] i suppose what pisses me off most about being an enfj is having such high expectations of others . i see inaction as equally bad as malice . [SEP] i wanted to take a bit of time to think about this before replying . i definitely think there are cultural impacts here . i've seen it time and again where a french person tries to kiss my cheek and i . . .

[SEP] drivers who don't use their indicators . people who don't say thank you after you hold the door for them . when it starts raining just as i have to go outside . [SEP] well that was just unnecessarily rude on their part . when we're nice, we get it thrown back in our faces . when we're rightfully pissed off, we're the bad guys . can't win : dry : [SEP] they hate us cos they ain't us . also, trump is meant to be an estp so that doesn't represent us very well .

INTP	 yea, i do think that ints & other introspective types have similar characteristics to schizoids, and also are therefore, potentially, more apt to develop those feelings of alienation, etc . [SEP] i can imagine that a lot of entjs would be attracted to the military too . thank you for saying that you like to make others feel comfortable, i've definitely noticed an infj doing that & originally . . . [SEP] both my brother & i need to develop our inferior functions as well . i think he is also still immature in certain ways, more so than i am, but i definitely come off the wrong way to him all the time & . . .

[SEP] haha yea existential out pour has gotten me into trouble with istps before [SEP] avoid theoretical business that can't be applied tangibly . istps like adventure . it is my opinion that an entj and istp will get along pretty well naturally so just be yourself but keep ya theories . . . [SEP] no, i don't think there is a link between intps & schizoids specifically . i think there's a link between high intelligence & schizoids however . also people who are ambidextrous, who are also usually . . . [SEP] extremely helpful, thank you . my fe is underdeveloped, but the rest is true as well . i do think he should deal with the reasons why he feels guilt, and then forgive himself . then take himself more . . . [SEP] thank you for your reply ! this made me think that perhaps the infj i know has a hard time initiating emotional contact . [SEP] esfjs and intps, please tell me about your relationships with the other type . i'd like to just hear what people have to say about the other type, how you get along, what you fight about, and how . . . [SEP] yes, as long as the infp is around the enfj, they won't be able to move on . this was very true of my infp ex bf .

[SEP] so, as enfp i am aware that we are the most introverted of all the extroverted types . i have gone through many phases of introversion to the point that i was knows as 'the shy girl' . this was years . . .

INFP	that sounds like a nightmare . one of my favorite things about the internet is the anonymity . also, like most people, i hate my own voice . [SEP] i've been there . i guess i'm still there actually but i don't let it get to me as much anymore . i've started trying to let go of everything i can't control, which includes the way people treat me . . . . [SEP] my best friends have been infj, esfp, and intp . the intp was the one i was most comfortable with .

[SEP] yeah . the whole time i was reading your reply, i was thinking, that sounds like something i would love doing for a short amount of time and then lose interest as soon as the novelty wore off . but . . . [SEP] i always wanted to be more scientifically literate . i applaud you for getting into that field . good luck with school next year ! [SEP] not sure if this has ever been asked . i was just curious because i know we usually don't willingly follow the status quo . i know i've had jobs that i hate because you can't really get around . . .

ENTP	 i mostly play a game called real life . best graphics and biggest versatility of gameplay, i gotta admit .

[SEP] again , intj , it's natural for you to not care about what people think . [SEP] it's easy to say like that when you're intj . intjs's in my experience don't give a damn about communicating with others .

[SEP] hello . i'm new to the forums . joined to hopefully find out my enneagram type or tritype . i look forward to talking more and if you have any interest in helping with my enneagram type, i've filled out . . .

[SEP] she may be an e, although i teeter between thinking i'm an i and an e and i've always thought she was more introverted than i was . we could both possibly just be more introverted extroverts .

INFJ	 here's one : __URL__ those who have a valentine, best wishes on your special day . to those who don't, welcome to the club . free beer for everyone ( or whatever you prefer ) ! [SEP] listing off only the traits that i dislike actually serves to answer both questions : spiritual/religious or in any way socially conservative arrogant or overly-prideful* prudish superficial . . . [SEP] everyone is capable of doing those things, many people do . there are likely to be underlying issues, yes . you don't have to be the guy's friend if you believe it to be so toxic . giving him space . . . [SEP] describe life in one word : what ? [SEP] truer words have never been spoken . [SEP] hehe . it really is that simple, isn't it ? [SEP] it's good that you are able to be honest . in any case, don't underestimate what you are capable of doing . that yearning you speak of is independent of any moral code . many people hold . . . [SEP] it is possible to be both angry at the world and listen to what others have to say, may i remind you . > : ] the rest is highly dependent on what show you want to see and what you're shopping for . i . . . [SEP] i'm sorry that happened to you, both in terms of the failed business and relationship . financial trouble doesn't help either . if you feel as though you are about to hit bottom, it might be time . . . [SEP] i applaud you sir . you say it like it is, save a few fortunate ones that have truckloads of cash . [SEP] nope, none to speak of . talk to my mom's side of the family though and there's plenty of that . not so much karma, but super jesus types . [SEP] that's ok, send them my way will you ? seriously though, it's not that important to me that women have tats or piercings . i don't have any myself . . yet . maybe when i have more money . dude, i . . . 
INFJ	 not necessarily . the description given in the books are a overall strive for knowledge and enlightenment . the quirky part can be attributed to any house, standing out is gryffindor, and the being . . . [SEP] what super-hero are you which animal would you pick as your pet ? -bat -spider -any from asgard, my home land -i come from a planet that exploded, therefore i don't know any animals from earth . [SEP] not really . he isn't afraid of the world . i bet that if sherlock was a real dude he would hate the world . why ? because everyone is slow . beating boredom isn't a coping mechanism because he isn't . . . [SEP] but in the books ( and bbc ) sherlock is completely deprived of sx and he is in no way concerned with danger + he isn't at all cautious . and he plays the violin and he is deeply in touch with art and . . . [SEP] i got quite surprised by spotlight, i could tell morgan freeman was surprised as well . lol, but it isn't really wrong though . it was more likely for the revenant, but mad max was brilliant, plus . . . [SEP] yes, i am sure that i will be quite surprised with the winners . [SEP] lol, fixed the blue . btw, thanks for that ( the part that i bolded ) , and yes i agree with your opinions . i tried to swallow my personal opinion and remain unbiased . otherwise, it would be just my . . . [SEP] title pretty much says it all . my predictions for today ( red is the winner, blue is my second choice and the rest are the nominees . the other nominees are in alphabetical order ) : best motion . . . [SEP] __URL__ neutral good . although i got chaotic good sometimes . [SEP] oh, okay thanks a lot man ! : wink : [SEP] i don't see as pointless to argue, but yes you could make strong arguments for both . and what you said about jk is pure ni, not ne . ne acts differently . she would kind of debate about it, or . . . [SEP] oh, okay . interesting, what if i am in between ? what does that change ? i think i am predominantly reactive, but i am mostly 50/50 . but if i needed to type my nature between balanced and . . . 
INTJ	 the problem with that perspective is its inherent failure to understand the nature of mankind . you truly believe that you not only can, but actually do hold the pendulum in check, but what you are . . . [SEP] actually, that was fairly succinct . . . and stated in a much kinder, gentler manner than many others would have put it . i am not a boomer, but the writing was on the walls back as far as i can remember . . . [SEP] there are only three things i know for sure : 1 . lego minifigures will outnumber humans by 2020 . 2 . david tenant was the best doctor ; also amy pond the best companion for that matter 3 . linux, . . . [SEP] apparently my interpretation of humor is lacking according to coy ( although i don't believe his iq is that low . . . another joke ? ) , but based on his statement alone, i got the distinct impression that . . . 
INTJ	 i start writing and figure it out as i go . this has never failed me . [SEP] personality is not nearly as stable across the lifespan as some believe . children and adolescents, in general, are more extroverted, more open, and less conscientious . ( i . e . are pulled more in the . . . [SEP] i'll put explanations next to typings that go against the consensus or are otherwise unconventional . qui-gon : infj obi-wan : infj ( he acts more like an istj in the prequels - stern, irritable, . . . [SEP] to return to the op : the reason some say he has been typed as isfp is that for some inexplicable reason he was listed as one on some early internet type pages . i can't find any of them still standing . . . [SEP] i'm going to be serious myself for a second . you can argue that trump is smart in the same kind of way a lot of sociopaths ( and estps ) are smart : good at manipulating and conning gullible idiots . . . . [SEP] __URL__ point is he's accusing people of being retarded self-typed sensors simply for not agreeing with him ( which in his mind means you're dumber than him ) , implying s is inherently retarded unlike . . . [SEP] again, i do not see what there is to interpret . it is clear . you are the one who evidently does not understand what you read . let's break it down again . he's not entirely wrong, but . . . [SEP] no . no it was definitely sweeping generalization . . . . what ? what he said and what he meant was abundantly, obviously clear in context . like there is no doubt about it . he's saying the reason . . . [SEP] no, only i am . he only thinks he is . what is a critical hit if not calling others retarded and variations thereof, directly and indirectly ? if you mean only that my insults had more wit . . . [SEP] because it did . and notice i was still attacking only the statement, which he still had not clarified at all, not the person making the statement . he was most definitely the first to get personal . . . . [SEP] uh . . . it's true that he thinks that, clearly . but what he thinks sure as fuck is not actually true . [SEP] i understand that, but he's still wrong . if he wants to start a whole new interpretation of jung of his own, fine . but to claim that somehow the mbti test indicates the opposite preferences for e/i . . .

[SEP] i, unfortunately, have school tomorrow . it is currently 11 : 30 and i must be heading off to bed, seeing as i live incredibly far away from school and have to wake up early . good night everyone, i hope . . .

ISFP	an amazing live performance by john mayer ( watched on youtube ) made me smile today . : ) as well as some nice people . [SEP] i love reading and music . my self-expression is mostly through writing, poetry . i probably want to start writing short stories soon .

[SEP] thanks guys . . . i think isfj does sound a bit more like me to me [SEP] i think this sounds very istp . . . sorry about the boring response lol but i'm not skilled enough yet at typing to say anything else, i see the thinking, sensing, intuition, and feeling : p [SEP] hey, i'm sort of having doubts about me being dominant ti and inferior fe, so this is another questionnaire just to check 0 . is there anything that may affect the way you answer the questions ? for . . . 
ENTJ	 sounds just like a moron who is trying to be funny . probably didn't mean to offend you, he's just an idiot . refer to my above post to the lonely intj woman . he probably just really wants to have sex . . . [SEP] paraphrased : i was being a boring intj as usual . when he wasn't receptive to my blatant insults ( wit ) , he told me to buy a cat and some yarn, because i'd surely be needing them . the feeling is . . . [SEP] because of our warm and gentle nature . [SEP] barack obama was born and raised in a chinese military bunker .

( sorry my portuguese bad ) [SEP] upholding social tact is subjective . i . demand . questions . . . . : @ [SEP] don't worry about gaining our trust, worry more about losing it . i tend to fully trust anyone i have respect for, but if they lie to me or disrespect me it can be hard for them to gain it back . . . . [SEP] caught her getting coffee inside the school . she initiated the conversation by saying sorry but she had to leave for an appointment, she just couldn't say it before we had to be quiet . i caught her . . .
