ENFJ	i am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation sep five score years ago, a great american, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the emancipation proclamation sep this momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice sep it came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity sep but one hundred years later, the negro still is not free sep one hundred years later, the life of the negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination sep one hundred years later, the negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity sep one hundred years later, the negro is still languished in the corners of american society and finds himself an exile in his own land sep and so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition sep in a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check sep when the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the constitution and the declaration of independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every american was to fall heir sep this note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the "unalienable rights" of "life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness sep " it is obvious today that america has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned sep instead of honoring this sacred obligation, america has given the negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked "insufficient funds sep "but we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt sep we refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation sep and so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice sep we have also come to this hallowed spot to remind america of the fierce urgency of now sep this is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism sep now is the time to make real the promises of democracy sep now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice sep now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood sep now is the time to make justice a reality for all of god's children sep it would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment sep this sweltering summer of the negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality sep nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning sep and those who hope that the negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual sep and there will be neither rest nor tranquility in america until the negro is granted his citizenship rights sep the whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges sep but there is something that i must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: in the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds sep let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred sep we must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline sep we must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence sep again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force sep the marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny sep and they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom sep we cannot walk alone sep and as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead sep we cannot turn back sep there are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, "when will you be satisfied sep " we can never be satisfied as long as the negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality sep we can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities sep **we cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one sep we can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: "for whites only sep "** we cannot be satisfied as long as a negro in mississippi cannot vote and a negro in new york believes he has nothing for which to vote sep no, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until "justice rolls down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream sep "i am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations sep some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells sep and some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality sep you have been the veterans of creative suffering sep continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive sep go back to mississippi, go back to alabama, go back to south carolina, go back to georgia, go back to louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed sep let us not wallow in the valley of despair, i say to you today, my friends sep and so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, i still have a dream sep it is a dream deeply rooted in the american dream sep i have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal sep "i have a dream that one day on the red hills of georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood sep i have a dream that one day even the state of mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice sep i have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character sep i have a dream today sep i have a dream that one day, down in alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of "interposition" and "nullification" -- one day right there in alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers sep i have a dream today sep i have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; "and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together sep "2this is our hope, and this is the faith that i go back to the south with sep with this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope sep with this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood sep with this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day sep and this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of god's children will be able to sing with new meaning: my country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee i sing sep land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring sep and if america is to be a great nation, this must become true sep and so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of new hampshire sep let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of new york sep let freedom ring from the heightening alleghenies of pennsylvania sep let freedom ring from the snow-capped rockies of colorado sep let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of california sep but not only that: let freedom ring from stone mountain of georgia sep let freedom ring from lookout mountain of tennessee sep let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of mississippi sep from every mountainside, let freedom ring sep and when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of god's children, black men and white men, jews and gentiles, protestants and catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old negro spiritual: free at last sep free at last sep thank god almighty, we are free at last
ESFP	vice president johnson, mr sep speaker, mr sep chief justice, president eisenhower, vice president nixon, president truman, reverend clergy, fellow citizens: we observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom -- symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning -- signifying renewal, as well as change sep for i have sworn before you and almighty god the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three-quarters ago sep the world is very different now sep for man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life sep and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe -- the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of god sep we dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution sep let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans -- born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage, and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world sep let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival and the success of liberty sep this much we pledge -- and more sep to those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends sep united there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures sep divided there is little we can do -- for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder sep to those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny sep we shall not always expect to find them supporting our view sep but we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom -- and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside sep to those people in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required -- not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right sep if a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich sep to our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge: to convert our good words into good deeds, in a new alliance for progress, to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty sep but this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers sep let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the americas sep and let every other power know that this hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house sep to that world assembly of sovereign states, the united nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support -- to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective, to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak, and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run sep finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction sep we dare not tempt them with weakness sep for only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed sep but neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course -- both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war sep so let us begin anew -- remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof sep let us never negotiate out of fear, but let us never fear to negotiate sep let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us sep let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms, and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations sep let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors sep together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce sep let both sides unite to heed, in all corners of the earth, the command of isaiah -- to "undo the heavy burdens, and [to] let the oppressed go free sep "and, if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor -- not a new balance of power, but a new world of law -- where the strong are just, and the weak secure, and the peace preserved sep all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days sep nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days; nor in the life of this administration; nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet sep but let us begin sep in your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course sep since this country was founded, each generation of americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty sep the graves of young americans who answered the call to service surround the globe sep now the trumpet summons us again -- not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need -- not as a call to battle, though embattled we are -- but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, "ejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation," a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease, and war itself sep can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, north and south, east and west, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind sep will you join in that historic effort sep in the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger sep i do not shrink from this responsibility -- i welcome it sep i do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation sep the energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it sep and the glow from that fire can truly light the world sep and so, my fellow americans, ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country sep my fellow citizens of the world, ask not what america will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man sep finally, whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you sep with a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking his blessing and his help, but knowing that here on earth god's work must truly be our own sep
ENTJ	president hoover, mr sep chief justice, my friends: this is a day of national consecration sep and i am certain that on this day my fellow americans expect that on my induction into the presidency, i will address them with a candor and a decision which the present situation of our people impels sep this is preeminently the time to speak the truth, the whole truth, frankly and boldly sep nor need we shrink from honestly facing conditions in our country today sep this great nation will endure, as it has endured, will revive and will prosper sep so, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -- nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance sep in every dark hour of our national life, a leadership of frankness and of vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory sep and i am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days sep in such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties sep they concern, thank god, only material things sep values have shrunk to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; and the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone sep more important, a host of unemployed citizens face the grim problem of existence, and an equally great number toil with little return sep only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the moment sep and yet our distress comes from no failure of substance sep we are stricken by no plague of locusts sep compared with the perils which our forefathers conquered, because they believed and were not afraid, we have still much to be thankful for sep nature still offers her bounty and human efforts have multiplied it sep plenty is at our doorstep, but a generous use of it languishes in the very sight of the supply sep primarily, this is because the rulers of the exchange of mankind's goods have failed, through their own stubbornness and their own incompetence, have admitted their failure, and have abdicated sep practices of the unscrupulous money changers stand indicted in the court of public opinion, rejected by the hearts and minds of men sep true, they have tried sep but their efforts have been cast in the pattern of an outworn tradition sep faced by failure of credit, they have proposed only the lending of more money sep stripped of the lure of profit by which to induce our people to follow their false leadership, they have resorted to exhortations, pleading tearfully for restored confidence sep they only know the rules of a generation of self-seekers sep they have no vision, and when there is no vision the people perish sep yes, the money changers have fled from their high seats in the temple of our civilization sep we may now restore that temple to the ancient truths sep the measure of that restoration lies in the extent to which we apply social values more noble than mere monetary profit sep happiness lies not in the mere possession of money; it lies in the joy of achievement, in the thrill of creative effort sep the joy, the moral stimulation of work no longer must be forgotten in the mad chase of evanescent profits sep these dark days, my friends, will be worth all they cost us if they teach us that our true destiny is not to be ministered unto but to minister to ourselves, to our fellow men sep recognition of that falsity of material wealth as the standard of success goes hand in hand with the abandonment of the false belief that public office and high political position are to be valued only by the standards of pride of place and personal profit; and there must be an end to a conduct in banking and in business which too often has given to a sacred trust the likeness of callous and selfish wrongdoing sep small wonder that confidence languishes, for it thrives only on honesty, on honor, on the sacredness of obligations, on faithful protection, and on unselfish performance; without them it cannot live sep restoration calls, however, not for changes in ethics alone sep this nation is asking for action, and action now sep our greatest primary task is to put people to work sep this is no unsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously sep it can be accomplished in part by direct recruiting by the government itself, treating the task as we would treat the emergency of a war, but at the same time, through this employment, accomplishing great -- greatly needed projects to stimulate and reorganize the use of our great natural resources sep hand in hand with that we must frankly recognize the overbalance of population in our industrial centers and, by engaging on a national scale in a redistribution, endeavor to provide a better use of the land for those best fitted for the land sep yes, the task can be helped by definite efforts to raise the values of agricultural products, and with this the power to purchase the output of our cities sep it can be helped by preventing realistically the tragedy of the growing loss through foreclosure of our small homes and our farms sep it can be helped by insistence that the federal, the state, and the local governments act forthwith on the demand that their cost be drastically reduced sep it can be helped by the unifying of relief activities which today are often scattered, uneconomical, unequal sep it can be helped by national planning for and supervision of all forms of transportation and of communications and other utilities that have a definitely public character sep there are many ways in which it can be helped, but it can never be helped by merely talking about it sep we must act sep we must act quickly sep and finally, in our progress towards a resumption of work, we require two safeguards against a return of the evils of the old order sep there must be a strict supervision of all banking and credits and investments sep there must be an end to speculation with other people's money sep and there must be provision for an adequate but sound currency sep these, my friends, are the lines of attack sep i shall presently urge upon a new congress in special session detailed measures for their fulfillment, and i shall seek the immediate assistance of the 48 states sep through this program of action we address ourselves to putting our own national house in order and making income balance outgo sep our international trade relations, though vastly important, are in point of time, and necessity, secondary to the establishment of a sound national economy sep i favor, as a practical policy, the putting of first things first sep i shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment; but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment sep the basic thought that guides these specific means of national recovery is not nationally -- narrowly nationalistic sep it is the insistence, as a first consideration, upon the interdependence of the various elements in and parts of the united states of america -- a recognition of the old and permanently important manifestation of the american spirit of the pioneer sep it is the way to recovery sep it is the immediate way sep it is the strongest assurance that recovery will endure sep in the field of world policy, i would dedicate this nation to the policy of the good neighbor: the neighbor who resolutely respects himself and, because he does so, respects the rights of others; the neighbor who respects his obligations and respects the sanctity of his agreements in and with a world of neighbors sep if i read the temper of our people correctly, we now realize, as we have never realized before, our interdependence on each other; that we can not merely take, but we must give as well; that if we are to go forward, we must move as a trained and loyal army willing to sacrifice for the good of a common discipline, because without such discipline no progress can be made, no leadership becomes effective sep we are, i know, ready and willing to submit our lives and our property to such discipline, because it makes possible a leadership which aims at the larger good sep this, i propose to offer, pledging that the larger purposes will bind upon us, bind upon us all as a sacred obligation with a unity of duty hitherto evoked only in times of armed strife sep with this pledge taken, i assume unhesitatingly the leadership of this great army of our people dedicated to a disciplined attack upon our common problems sep action in this image, action to this end is feasible under the form of government which we have inherited from our ancestors sep our constitution is so simple, so practical that it is possible always to meet extraordinary needs by changes in emphasis and arrangement without loss of essential form sep that is why our constitutional system has proved itself the most superbly enduring political mechanism the modern world has ever seen sep it has met every stress of vast expansion of territory, of foreign wars, of bitter internal strife, of world relations sep and it is to be hoped that the normal balance of executive and legislative authority may be wholly equal, wholly adequate to meet the unprecedented task before us sep but it may be that an unprecedented demand and need for undelayed action may call for temporary departure from that normal balance of public procedure sep i am prepared under my constitutional duty to recommend the measures that a stricken nation in the midst of a stricken world may require sep these measures, or such other measures as the congress may build out of its experience and wisdom, i shall seek, within my constitutional authority, to bring to speedy adoption sep but, in the event that the congress shall fail to take one of these two courses, in the event that the national emergency is still critical, i shall not evade the clear course of duty that will then confront me sep i shall ask the congress for the one remaining instrument to meet the crisis -- broad executive power to wage a war against the emergency, as great as the power that would be given to me if we were in fact invaded by a foreign foe sep for the trust reposed in me, i will return the courage and the devotion that befit the time sep i can do no less sep we face the arduous days that lie before us in the warm courage of national unity; with the clear consciousness of seeking old and precious moral values; with the clean satisfaction that comes from the stern performance of duty by old and young alike sep we aim at the assurance of a rounded, a permanent national life sep we do not distrust the -- the future of essential democracy sep the people of the united states have not failed sep in their need they have registered a mandate that they want direct, vigorous action sep they have asked for discipline and direction under leadership sep they have made me the present instrument of their wishes sep in the spirit of the gift i take it sep in this dedication -- in this dedication of a nation, we humbly ask the blessing of god sep may he protect each and every one of us sep may he guide me in the days to come
ENTJ	mr sep vice president, mr sep speaker, members of the senate, and of the house of representatives: yesterday, december 7th, 1941 -- a date which will live in infamy -- the united states of america was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the empire of japan sep the united states was at peace with that nation and, at the solicitation of japan, was still in conversation with its government and its emperor looking toward the maintenance of peace in the pacific sep indeed, one hour after japanese air squadrons had commenced bombing in the american island of oahu, the japanese ambassador to the united states and his colleague delivered to our secretary of state a formal reply to a recent american message sep and while this reply stated that it seemed useless to continue the existing diplomatic negotiations, it contained no threat or hint of war or of armed attack sep 1it will be recorded that the distance of hawaii from japan makes it obvious that the attack was deliberately planned many days or even weeks ago sep during the intervening time, the japanese government has deliberately sought to deceive the united states by false statements and expressions of hope for continued peace sep the attack yesterday on the hawaiian islands has caused severe damage to american naval and military forces sep i regret to tell you that very many american lives have been lost sep in addition, american ships have been reported torpedoed on the high seas between san francisco and honolulu sep yesterday, the japanese government also launched an attack against malaya sep last night, japanese forces attacked hong kong sep last night, japanese forces attacked guam sep last night, japanese forces attacked the philippine islands sep last night, the japanese attacked wake island sep and this morning, the japanese attacked midway island sep japan has, therefore, undertaken a surprise offensive extending throughout the pacific area sep the facts of yesterday and today speak for themselves sep the people of the united states have already formed their opinions and well understand the implications to the very life and safety of our nation sep as commander in chief of the army and navy, i have directed that all measures be taken for our defense sep but always will our whole nation remember the character of the onslaught against us sep no matter how long it may take us to overcome this premeditated invasion, the american people in their righteous might will win through to absolute victory sep i believe that i interpret the will of the congress and of the people when i assert that we will not only defend ourselves to the uttermost, but will make it very certain that this form of treachery shall never again endanger us sep hostilities exist sep there is no blinking at the fact that our people, our territory, and our interests are in grave danger sep with confidence in our armed forces, with the unbounding determination of our people, we will gain the inevitable triumph -- so help us god sep i ask that the congress declare that since the unprovoked and dastardly attack by japan on sunday, december 7th, 1941, a state of war has existed between the united states and the japanese empire
ISTJ	my fellow americans,i come before you tonight as a candidate for the vice presidency and as a man whose honesty and -- and integrity has been questioned sep now, the usual political thing to do when charges are made against you is to either ignore them or to deny them without giving details sep i believe we've had enough of that in the united states, particularly with the present administration in washington, d sep c sep to me the office of the vice presidency of the united states is a great office, and i feel that the people have got to have confidence in the integrity of the men who run for that office and who might obtain it sep i have a theory, too, that the best and only answer to a smear or to an honest misunderstanding of the facts is to tell the truth sep and that's why i'm here tonight sep i want to tell you my side of the case sep i'm sure that you have read the charge, and you've heard it, that i, senator nixon, took 18,000 dollars from a group of my supporters sep now, was that wrong sep and let me say that it was wrong sep i'm saying, incidentally, that it was wrong, not just illegal, because it isn't a question of whether it was legal or illegal, that isn't enough sep the question is, was it morally wrong sep i say that it was morally wrong -- if any of that 18,000 dollars went to senator nixon, for my personal use sep i say that it was morally wrong if it was secretly given and secretly handled sep and i say that it was morally wrong if any of the contributors got special favors for the contributions that they made sep and now to answer those questions let me say this: not one cent of the 18,000 dollars or any other money of that type ever went to me for my personal use sep every penny of it was used to pay for political expenses that i did not think should be charged to the taxpayers of the united states sep it was not a secret fund sep as a matter of fact, when i was on "meet the press" -- some of you may have seen it last sunday -- peter edson came up to me after the program, and he said, "dick, what about this "fund" we hear about sep " and i said, "well, there's no secret about it sep go out and see dana smith who was the administrator of the fund sep " and i gave him [edson] his [smith's] address sep and i said you will find that the purpose of the fund simply was to defray political expenses that i did not feel should be charged to the government sep and third, let me point out -- and i want to make this particularly clear -- that no contributor to this fund, no contributor to any of my campaigns, has ever received any consideration that he would not have received as an ordinary constituent sep i just don't believe in that, and i can say that never, while i have been in the senate of the united states, as far as the people that contributed to this fund are concerned, have i made a telephone call for them to an agency, or have i gone down to an agency in their behalf sep and the records will show that, the records which are in the hands of the administration sep well, then, some of you will say, and rightly, "well, what did you use the fund for, senator sep " "why did you have to have it sep " let me tell you in just a word how a senate office operates sep first of all, a senator gets 15,000 dollars a year in salary sep he gets enough money to pay for one trip a year -- a round trip, that is -- for himself and his family between his home and washington, d sep c sep and then he gets an allowance to handle the people that work in his office to handle his mail sep and the allowance for my state of california is enough to hire 13 people sep and let me say, incidentally, that that allowance is not paid to the senator sep it's paid directly to the individuals that the senator puts on his pay roll sep but all of these people and all of these allowances are for strictly official business; business, for example, when a constituent writes in and wants you to go down to the veteran's administration and get some information about his gi policy -- items of that type, for example sep but there are other expenses which are not covered by the government sep and i think i can best discuss those expenses by asking you some questions sep do you think that when i or any other senator makes a political speech, has it printed, should charge the printing of that speech and the mailing of that speech to the taxpayers sep do you think, for example, when i or any other senator makes a trip to his home state to make a purely political speech that the cost of that trip should be charged to the taxpayers sep do you think when a senator makes political broadcasts or political television broadcasts, radio or television, that the expense of those broadcasts should be charged to the taxpayers sep well i know what your answer is sep it's the same answer that audiences give me whenever i discuss this particular problem: the answer is no sep the taxpayers shouldn't be required to finance items which are not official business but which are primarily political business sep well, then the question arises, you say, "well, how do you pay for these and how can you do it legally sep " and there are several ways that it can be done, incidentally, and that it is done legally in the united states senate and in the congress sep the first way is to be a rich man sep i don't happen to be a rich man, so i couldn't use that one sep another way that is used is to put your wife on the pay roll sep let me say, incidentally, that my opponent, my opposite number for the vice presidency on the democratic ticket, does have his wife on the pay roll and has had it -- her on his pay roll for the ten years -- for the past ten years sep now just let me say this: that's his business, and i'm not critical of him for doing that sep you will have to pass judgment on that particular point sep but i have never done that for this reason: i have found that there are so many deserving stenographers and secretaries in washington that needed the work that i just didn't feel it was right to put my wife on the pay roll sep my wife's sitting over here sep she's a wonderful stenographer sep she used to teach stenography and she used to teach shorthand in high school sep that was when i met her sep and i can tell you folks that she's worked many hours at night and many hours on saturdays and sundays in my office, and she's done a fine job, and i am proud to say tonight that in the six years i've been in the house and the senate of the united states, pat nixon has never been on the government pay roll sep what are other ways that these finances can be taken care of sep some who are lawyers, and i happen to be a lawyer, continue to practice law, but i haven't been able to do that sep i'm so far away from california that i've been so busy with my senatorial work that i have not engaged in any legal practice sep and, also, as far as law practice is concerned, it seemed to me that the relationship between an attorney and the client was so personal that you couldn't possibly represent a man as an attorney and then have an unbiased view when he presented his case to you in the event that he had one before government sep and so i felt that the best way to handle these necessary political expenses of getting my message to the american people and the speeches i made -- the speeches that i had printed for the most part concerned this one message of exposing this administration, the communism in it, the corruption in it -- the only way that i could do that was to accept the aid which people in my home state of california, who contributed to my campaign and who continued to make these contributions after i was elected, were glad to make sep and let me say i'm proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me for a special favor sep i'm proud of the fact that not one of them has ever asked me to vote on a bill other than of my own conscience would dictate sep and i am proud of the fact that the taxpayers, by subterfuge or otherwise, have never paid one dime for expenses which i thought were political and shouldn't be charged to the taxpayers sep let me say, incidentally, that some of you may say, "well, that's all right, senator, that's your explanation, but have you got any proof sep " and i'd like to tell you this evening that just an hour ago we received an independent audit of this entire fund sep i suggested to governor sherman adams, who is the chief of staff of the dwight eisenhower campaign, that an independent audit and legal report be obtained, and i have that audit here in my hands sep it's an audit made by the price waterhouse & company firm, and the legal opinion by gibson, dunn, & crutcher, lawyers in los angeles, the biggest law firm, and incidentally, one of the best ones in los angeles sep i am proud to be able to report to you tonight that this audit and this legal opinion is being forwarded to general eisenhower sep and i'd like to read to you the opinion that was prepared by gibson, dunn, & crutcher, and based on all the pertinent laws and statutes, together with the audit report prepared by the certified public accountants sep quote: it is our conclusion that senator nixon did not obtain any financial gain from the collection and disbursement of the fund by dana smith; that senator nixon did not violate any federal or state law by reason of the operation of the fund; and that neither the portion of the fund paid by dana smith directly to third persons, nor the portion paid to senator nixon, to reimburse him for designated office expenses, constituted income to the senator which was either reportable or taxable as income under applicable tax laws sep (signed) gibson, dunn, & crutcher, by elmo h sep conleynow that, my friends, is not nixon speaking, but that's an independent audit which was requested, because i want the american people to know all the facts, and i am not afraid of having independent people go in and check the facts, and that is exactly what they did sep but then i realized that there are still some who may say, and rightfully so -- and let me say that i recognize that some will continue to smear regardless of what the truth may be -- but that there has been, understandably, some honest misunderstanding on this matter, and there are some that will say, "well, maybe you were able, senator, to fake this thing sep how can we believe what you say sep after all, is there a possibility that maybe you got some sums in cash sep is there a possibility that you may have feathered your own nest sep " and so now, what i am going to do -- and incidentally this is unprecedented in the history of american politics -- i am going at this time to give to this television and radio audio -- audience, a complete financial history, everything i've earned, everything i've spent, everything i own sep and i want you to know the facts sep i'll have to start early sep i was born in 1913 sep our family was one of modest circumstances, and most of my early life was spent in a store out in east whittier sep it was a grocery store, one of those family enterprises sep the only reason we were able to make it go was because my mother and dad had five boys, and we all worked in the store sep i worked my way through college, and, to a great extent, through law school sep and then in 1940, probably the best thing that ever happened to me happened sep i married pat who's sitting over here sep we had a rather difficult time after we were married, like so many of the young couples who may be listening to us sep i practiced law sep she continued to teach school sep then, in 1942, i went into the service sep let me say that my service record was not a particularly unusual one sep i went to the south pacific sep i guess i'm entitled to a couple of battle stars sep i got a couple of letters of commendation sep but i was just there when the bombs were falling sep and then i returned -- returned to the united states, and in 1946, i ran for the congress sep when we came out of the war -- pat and i -- pat during the war had worked as a stenographer, and in a bank, and as an economist for a government agency -- and when we came out, the total of our savings, from both my law practice, her teaching and all the time that i was in the war, the total for that entire period was just a little less than 10,000 dollars sep every cent of that, incidentally, was in government bonds sep well that's where we start, when i go into politics sep now, what have i earned since i went into politics sep well, here it is sep i've jotted it down sep let me read the notes sep first of all, i've had my salary as a congressman and as a senator sep second, i have received a total in this past six years of 1600 dollars from estates which were in my law firm at the time that i severed my connection with it sep and, incidentally, as i said before, i have not engaged in any legal practice and have not accepted any fees from business that came into the firm after i went into politics sep i have made an average of approximately 1500 dollars a year from nonpolitical speaking engagements and lectures sep and then, fortunately, we've inherited a little money sep pat sold her interest in her father's estate for 3,000 dollars, and i inherited 1500 dollars from my grandfather sep we lived rather modestly sep for four years we lived in an apartment in parkfairfax, in alexandria, virginia sep the rent was 80 dollars a month sep and we saved for the time that we could buy a house sep now, that was what we took in sep what did we do with this money sep what do we have today to show for it sep this will surprise you because it is so little, i suppose, as standards generally go of people in public life sep first of all, we've got a house in washington, which cost 41,000 dollars and on which we owe 20,000 dollars sep we have a house in whittier, california which cost 13,000 dollars and on which we owe 3000 dollars sep my folks are living there at the present time sep i have just 4000 dollars in life insurance, plus my gi policy which i've never been able to convert, and which will run out in two years sep i have no life insurance whatever on pat sep i have no life insurance on our two youngsters, tricia and julie sep i own a 1950 oldsmobile car sep we have our furniture sep we have no stocks and bonds of any type sep we have no interest of any kind, direct or indirect, in any business sep now, that's what we have sep what do we owe sep well in addition to the mortgage, the 20,000 dollar mortgage on the house in washington, the 10,000 dollar one on the house in whittier, i owe 4500 dollars to the riggs bank in washington, d sep c sep , with interest 4 and 1/2 percent sep i owe 3500 dollars to my parents, and the interest on that loan, which i pay regularly, because it's the part of the savings they made through the years they were working so hard -- i pay regularly 4 percent interest sep and then i have a 500 dollar loan, which i have on my life insurance sep well, that's about it sep that's what we have sep and that's what we owe sep it isn't very much sep but pat and i have the satisfaction that every dime that we've got is honestly ours sep i should say this, that pat doesn't have a mink coat sep but she does have a respectable republican cloth coat, and i always tell her she'd look good in anything sep one other thing i probably should tell you, because if i don't they'll probably be saying this about me, too sep we did get something, a gift, after the election sep a man down in texas heard pat on the radio mention the fact that our two youngsters would like to have a dog sep and believe it or not, the day before we left on this campaign trip we got a message from union station in baltimore, saying they had a package for us sep we went down to get it sep you know what it was sep it was a little cocker spaniel dog in a crate that he'd sent all the way from texas, black and white, spotted sep and our little girl tricia, the six year old, named it "checkers sep " and you know, the kids, like all kids, love the dog, and i just want to say this, right now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're gonna keep it sep it isn't easy to come before a nationwide audience and bare your life, as i've done sep but i want to say some things before i conclude that i think most of you will agree on sep mr sep mitchell, the chairman of the democratic national committee, made this statement -- that if a man couldn't afford to be in the united states senate, he shouldn't run for the senate sep and i just want to make my position clear sep i don't agree with mr sep mitchell when he says that only a rich man should serve his government in the united states senate or in the congress sep i don't believe that represents the thinking of the democratic party, and i know that it doesn't represent the thinking of the republican party sep i believe that it's fine that a man like governor stevenson, who inherited a fortune from his father, can run for president sep but i also feel that it's essential in this country of ours that a man of modest means can also run for president, because, you know, remember abraham lincoln, you remember what he said: "god must have loved the common people -- he made so many of them sep "and now i'm going to suggest some courses of conduct sep first of all, you have read in the papers about other funds, now sep mr sep stevenson apparently had a couple -- one of them in which a group of business people paid and helped to supplement the salaries of state employees sep here is where the money went directly into their pockets, and i think that what mr sep stevenson should do should be to come before the american people, as i have, give the names of the people that contributed to that fund, give the names of the people who put this money into their pockets at the same time that they were receiving money from their state government and see what favors, if any, they gave out for that sep i don't condemn mr sep stevenson for what he did, but until the facts are in there is a doubt that will be raised sep and as far as mr sep sparkman is concerned, i would suggest the same thing sep he's had his wife on the payroll sep i don't condemn him for that, but i think that he should come before the american people and indicate what outside sources of income he has had sep i would suggest that under the circumstances both mr sep sparkman and mr sep stevenson should come before the american people, as i have, and make a complete financial statement as to their financial history, and if they don't it will be an admission that they have something to hide sep and i think you will agree with me -- because, folks, remember, a man that's to be president of the united states, a man that's to be vice president of the united states, must have the confidence of all the people sep and that's why i'm doing what i'm doing sep and that's why i suggest that mr sep stevenson and mr sep sparkman, since they are under attack, should do what they're doing sep now let me say this: i know that this is not the last of the smears sep in spite of my explanation tonight, other smears will be made sep others have been made in the past sep and the purpose of the smears, i know, is this: to silence me; to make me let up sep well, they just don't know who they're dealing with sep i'm going to tell you this: i remember in the dark days of the hiss case some of the same columnists, some of the same radio commentators who are attacking me now and misrepresenting my position, were violently opposing me at the time i was after alger hiss sep but i continued to fight because i knew i was right, and i can say to this great television and radio audience that i have no apologies to the american people for my part in putting alger hiss where he is today sep and as far as this is concerned, i intend to continue to fight sep why do i feel so deeply sep why do i feel that in spite of the smears, the misunderstanding, the necessity for a man to come up here and bare his soul as i have -- why is it necessary for me to continue this fight sep and i want to tell you why sep because, you see, i love my country sep and i think my country is in danger sep and i think the only man that can save america at this time is the man that's running for president, on my ticket -- dwight eisenhower sep you say, "why do i think it is in danger sep " and i say, look at the record sep seven years of the truman-acheson administration, and what's happened sep six hundred million people lost to the communists sep and a war in korea in which we have lost 117,000 american casualties, and i say to all of you that a policy that results in the loss of 600 million people to the communists, and a war which cost us 117,000 american casualties isn't good enough for america sep and i say that those in the state department that made the mistakes which caused that war and which resulted in those losses should be kicked out of the state department just as fast as we get them out of there sep and let me say that i know mr sep stevenson won't do that because he defends the truman policy, and i know that dwight eisenhower will do that, and that he will give america the leadership that it needs sep take the problem of corruption sep you've read about the mess in washington sep mr sep stevenson can't clean it up because he was picked by the man, truman, under whose administration the mess was made sep you wouldn't trust the man who made the mess to clean it up sep that's truman sep and by the same token you can't trust the man who was picked by the man that made the mess to clean it up -- and that's stevenson sep and so i say, eisenhower, who owed nothing to truman, nothing to the big city bosses -- he is the man that can clean up the mess in washington sep take communism sep i say that as far as that subject is concerned the danger is great to america sep in the hiss case they got the secrets which enabled them to break the american secret state department code sep they got secrets in the atomic bomb case which enabled them to get the secret of the atomic bomb five years before they would have gotten it by their own devices sep and i say that any man who called the alger hiss case a red herring isn't fit to be president of the united states sep i say that a man who, like mr sep stevenson, has pooh-poohed and ridiculed the communist threat in the united states -- he said that they are phantoms among ourselves sep he has accused us that have attempted to expose the communists, of looking for communists in the bureau of fisheries and wildlife sep i say that a man who says that isn't qualified to be president of the united states sep and i say that the only man who can lead us in this fight to rid the government of both those who are communists and those who have corrupted this government is eisenhower, because eisenhower, you can be sure, recognizes the problem, and he knows how to deal with it sep now let me that finally, this evening, i want to read to you, just briefly, excerpts from a letter which i received, a letter which after all this is over no one can take away from us sep it reads as follows: dear senator nixon,since i am only 19 years of age, i can't vote in this presidential election, but believe me if i could you and general eisenhower would certainly get my vote sep my husband is in the fleet marines in korea sep he' a corpsman on the front lines and we have a two month old son he's never seen sep and i feel confident that with great americans like you and general eisenhower in the white house, lonely americans like myself will be united with their loved ones now in korea sep i only pray to god that you won't be too late sep enclosed is a small check to help you in your campaign sep living on $85 a month, it is all i can afford at present, but let me know what else i can do sep folks, it's a check for 10 dollars, and it's one that i will never cash sep and just let me say this: we hear a lot about prosperity these days, but i say why can't we have prosperity built on peace, rather than prosperity built on war sep why can't we have prosperity and an honest government in washington, d sep c sep , at the same time sep believe me, we can sep and eisenhower is the man that can lead this crusade to bring us that kind of prosperity sep and now, finally, i know that you wonder whether or not i am going to stay on the republican ticket or resign sep let me say this: i don't believe that i ought to quit, because i am not a quitter sep and, incidentally, pat's not a quitter sep after all, her name was patricia ryan and she was born on st sep patrick's day, and you know the irish never quit sep but the decision, my friends, is not mine sep i would do nothing that would harm the possibilities of dwight eisenhower to become president of the united states sep and for that reason i am submitting to the republican national committee tonight through this television broadcast the decision which it is theirs to make sep let them decide whether my position on the ticket will help or hurt sep and i am going to ask you to help them decide sep wire and write the republican national committee whether you think i should stay on or whether i should get off sep and whatever their decision is, i will abide by it sep but just let me say this last word: regardless of what happens, i'm going to continue this fight sep i'm going to campaign up and down in america until we drive the crooks and the communists and those that defend them out of washington sep and remember folks, eisenhower is a great man, believe me sep he's a great man sep and a vote for eisenhower is a vote for what's good for america sep and what's good for america -- [interrupted by announcer]
ENTJ	mr sep moderator, rev sep cleage, brothers and sisters and friends, and i see some enemies sep [laughter, applause] in fact, i think we'd be fooling ourselves if we had an audience this large and didn't realize that there were some enemies present sep this afternoon we want to talk about the ballot or the bullet sep the ballot or the bullet explains itself sep but before we get into it, since this is the year of the ballot or the bullet, i would like to clarify some things that refer to me personally, concerning my own personal position sep i'm still a muslim sep that is, my religion is still islam sep [applause] my religion is still islam sep i still credit mr sep muhammad for what i know and what i am sep he's the one who opened my eyes sep [applause] at present i am the minister of the newly founded muslim mosque incorporated, which has its offices in the theresa hotel right in the heart of harlem, that's the black belt in new york city sep and when we realize that adam clayton powell, is a christian minister, he has abyssinian baptist church, but at the same time he's more famous for his political struggling sep and dr sep king is a christian minister from atlanta georgia, or in atlanta georgia, but he's become more famous for being involved in the civil rights struggle sep there's another in new york, rev sep galamison, i don't know if you've heard of him out here, he's a christian minister from brooklyn, but has become famous for his fight against the segregated school system in brooklyn sep rev sep cleage, right here, is a christian minister, here in detroit, he's head of the freedom now party sep all of these are christian ministers [applause] &all of these are christian ministers but they don't come to us as christian ministers, they come to us as fighters in some other category sep i am a muslim minister sep the same as they are christian ministers, i'm a muslim minister sep and i don't believe in fighting today on any one front, but on all fronts sep [applause] in fact, i'm a black nationalist freedom fighter sep [applause] islam is my religion but i believe my religion is my personal business sep [applause] it governs my personal life, my personal morals sep and my religious philosophy is personal between me and the god in whom i believe, just as the religious philosophy of these others is between them and the god in whom they believe sep and this is best this way sep were we to come out here discussing religion, we'd have too many differences from the out start and we could never get together sep so today, though islam is my religious philosophy, my political, economic and social philosophy is black nationalism sep you and i  [applause] as i say, if we bring up religion, we'll have differences, we'll have arguments, and we'll never be able to get together sep but if we keep our religion at home, keep our religion in the closet, keep our religion between ourselves and our god, but when we come out here we have a fight that's common to all of us against a enemy who is common to all of us sep [applause]the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that the black man should control the politics and the politicians in his own community sep the time when white people can come in our community and get us to vote for them so that they can be our political leaders and tell us what to do and what not to do is long gone sep [applause]by the same token, the time when that same white man, knowing that your eyes are too far open, can send another negro in the community, and get you and me to support him, so that he can use him to lead us astray, those days are long gone too sep [applause]the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that if you and i are going to live in a black community  and that's where we're going to live, 'cause as soon as you move into one of their& sep soon as you move out of the black community into their community, it's mixed for a period of time, but they're gone and you're right there all by yourself again sep [applause]we must, we must understand the politics of our community and we must know what politics is supposed to produce sep we must know what part politics play in our lives sep and until we become politically mature, we will always be misled, led astray, or deceived or maneuvered into supporting someone politically who doesn't have the good of our community at heart sep so the political philosophy of black nationalism only means that we will have to carry on a program, a political program, of reeducation  to open our people's eyes, make us become more politically conscious, politically mature sep and then, we will  whenever we are ready to cast our ballot, that ballot will be cast for a man of the community, who has the good of the community at heart sep [applause]the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we should own and operate and control the economy of our community sep you would never have foundyou can't open up a black store in a white community sep white man won't even patronize you sep and he's not wrong sep he got sense enough to look out for himself sep it's you who don't have sense enough to look out for yourself sep [applause]the white man, the white man is too intelligent to let someone else come and gain control of the economy of his community sep but you will let anybody come in and control the economy of your community, control the housing, control the education, control the jobs, control the businesses, under the pretext that you want to integrate sep nah, you're out of your mind sep [applause]the political & the economic philosophy of black nationalism only means that we have to become involved in a program of reeducation, to educate our people into the importance of knowing that when you spend your dollar out of the community in which you live, the community in which you spend your money becomes richer and richer, the community out of which you take your money becomes poorer and poorer sep and because these negroes, who have been misled, misguided, are breaking their necks to take their money and spend it with the man, the man is becoming richer and richer, and you're becoming poorer and poorer sep and then what happens sep the community in which you live becomes a slum sep it becomes a ghetto sep the conditions become rundown sep and then you have the audacity to complain about poor housing in a rundown community, while you're running down yourselves when you take your dollar out sep [applause]and you and i are in a double trap because not only do we lose by taking our money someplace else and spending it, when we try and spend it in our own community we're trapped because we haven't had sense enough to set up stores and control the businesses of our community sep the man who is controlling the stores in our community is a man who doesn't look like we do sep he's a man who doesn't even live in the community sep so you and i, even when we try and spend our money on the block where we live or the area where we live, we're spending it with a man who, when the sun goes down, takes that basket full of money in another part of the town sep [applause]so we're trapped, trapped, double-trapped, triple-trapped sep any way we go, we find that we're trapped sep any every kind of solution that someone comes up with is just another trap sep but the political and economic philosophy of black nationalismthe economic philosophy of black nationalism shows our people the importance of setting up these little stores, and developing them and expanding them into larger operations sep woolworth didn't start out big like they are today; they started out with a dime store, and expanded, and expanded, and expanded until today they are all over the country and all over the world and they getting some of everybody's money sep now this is what you and i sep general motors, the same way, it didn't start out like i"is sep it started out just a little rat-race type operation sep and it expanded and it expanded until today it's where it is right now sep and you and i have to make a start sep and the best place to start is right in the community where we live sep [applause]so our people not only have to be reeducated to the importance of supporting black business, but the black man himself has to be made aware of the importance of going into business sep and once you and i go into business, we own and operate at least the businesses in our community sep what we will be doing is developing a situation, wherein, we will actually be able to create employment for the people in the community sep and once you can create some employment in the community where you live, it will eliminate the necessity of you and me having to act ignorantly and disgracefully, boycotting and picketing some cracker someplace else trying to beg him for a job sep [applause]anytime you have to rely upon your enemy for a job, you're in bad shape sep [applause] when you sep and he is your enemy sep you wouldn't be in this country if some enemy hadn't kidnapped you and brought you here sep [applause] on the other hand, some of you think you came here on the mayflower sep [laughter]so as you can see, brothers and sisters, today sep this afternoon it is not our intention to discuss religion sep we're going to forget religion sep if we bring up religion we'll be in an argument sep and the best way to keep away from arguments and differences, as i said earlier, put your religion at home, in the closet, keep it between you and your god sep because if it hasn't done anything more for you than it has, you need to forget it anyway sep [laughter, applause]whether you are a christian or a muslim or a nationalist, we all have the same problem sep they don't hang you because you're a baptist; they hang you 'cause you're black sep [applause] they don't attack me because i'm a muslim sep they attack me 'cause i'm black sep they attacked all of us for the same reason sep all of us catch hell from the same enemy sep we're all in the same bag, in the same boat sep we suffer political oppression, economic exploitation and social degradation sep all of 'em from the same enemy sep the government has failed us sep you can't deny that sep any time you're living in the 20th century, 1964, and you walking around here singing "we shall overcome," the government has failed you sep [applause] this is part of what's wrong with you, you do too much singing sep [laughter] today it's time to stop singing and start swinging sep [laughter, applause]you can't sing up on freedom sep but you can swing up on some freedom sep [cheering] cassius clay can sing sep but singing didn't help him to become the heavyweight champion of the world sep swinging helped him sep [applause]so this government has failed us sep the government itself has failed us sep and the white liberals who have been posing as our friends have failed us sep and once we see that all of these other sources to which we've turned have failed, we stop turning to them and turn to ourselves sep we need a self-help program, a do-it-yourself philosophy, a do-it-right-now philosophy, a it's-already-too-late philosophy sep this is what you and i need to get with sep and the only time sep the only way we're going to solve our problem is with a self-help program sep before we can get a self-help program started, we have to have a self-help philosophy sep black nationalism is a self-help philosophy sep what's so good about it sep you can stay right in the church where you are and still take black nationalism as your philosophy sep you can stay in any kind of civic organization that you belong to and still take black nationalism as your philosophy sep you can be an atheist and still take black nationalism as your philosophy sep this is a philosophy that eliminates the necessity for division and argument, 'cause if you're black, you should be thinking black sep and if you're black and you not thinking black at this late date, well, i'm sorry for you sep [applause]once you change your philosophy, you change your thought pattern sep once you change your thought pattern you change your attitude sep once you change your attitude it changes your behavior pattern sep and then you go on into some action sep as long as you got a sit-down philosophy you'll have a sit-down thought pattern sep and as long as you think that old sit-down thought, you'll be in some kind of sit-down action sep they'll have you sitting in everywhere sep [laughter]it's not so good to refer to what you're going to do as a sit-in sep that right there castrates you sep right there it brings you down sep what goes with it sep what sep think of the image of someone sitting sep an old woman can sit sep an old man can sit sep a chump can sit, a coward can sit, anything can sit sep well, you and i been sitting long enough and it's time for us today to start doing some standing and some fighting to back that up sep [applause]when we look at other parts of this earth upon which we live, we find that black, brown, red and yellow people in africa and asia are getting their independence sep they're not getting it by singing, 'we shall overcome sep " no, they're getting it through nationalism sep it is nationalism that brought about the independence of the people in asia sep every nation in asia gained its independence through the philosophy of nationalism sep every nation on the african continent that has gotten its independence brought it about through the philosophy of nationalism sep and it will take black nationalism to bring about the freedom of 22 million afro-americans, here in this country, where we have suffered colonialism for the past 400 years sep [applause]america is just as much a colonial power as england ever was sep america is just as much a colonial power as france ever was sep in fact, america is more so a colonial power than they, because she is a hypocritical colonial power behind it sep [applause] what is 20th sep what, what do you call second-class citizenship sep why, that's colonization sep second-class citizenship is nothing but 20th slavery sep how you gonna to tell me you're a second-class citizen sep they don't have second-class citizenship in any other government on this earth sep they just have slaves and people who are free sep well, this country is a hypocrite sep they try and make you think they set you free by calling you a second-class citizen sep no, you're nothing but a 20th century slave sep [applause]just as it took nationalism to remove colonialism from asia and africa, it'll take black nationalism today to remove colonialism from the backs and the minds of twenty-two million afro-americans here in this country sep and 1964 looks like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet sep [applause]why does it look like it might be the year of the ballot or the bullet sep because negroes have listened to the trickery and the lies and the false promises of the white man now for too long, and they're fed up sep they've become disenchanted sep they've become disillusioned sep they've become dissatisfied sep and all of this has built up frustrations in the black community that makes the black community throughout america today more explosive than all of the atomic bombs the russians can ever invent sep whenever you got a racial powder keg sitting in your lap, you're in more trouble than if you had an atomic powder keg sitting in your lap sep when a racial powder keg goes off, it doesn't care who it knocks out the way sep understand this, it's dangerous sep and in 1964, this seems to be the year sep because what can the white man use, now, to fool us sep after he put down that march on washington sep and you see all through that now, he tricked you, had you marching down to washington sep had you marching back and forth between the feet of a dead man named lincoln and another dead man named george washington, singing, "we shall overcome sep " [applause]he made a chump out of you sep he made a fool out of you sep he made you think you were going somewhere and you end up going nowhere but between lincoln and washington sep [laughter]so today our people are disillusioned sep they've become disenchanted sep they've become dissatisfied sep and in their frustrations they want action sep and in 1964 you'll see this young black man, this new generation, asking for the ballot or the bullet sep that old uncle tom action is outdated sep the young generation don't want to hear anything about "the odds are against us sep " what do we care about odds sep [applause]when this country here was first being founded, there were thirteen colonies sep the whites were colonized sep they were fed up with this taxation without representation sep so some of them stood up and said, "liberty or death sep " i went to a white school over here in mason, michigan sep the white man made the mistake of letting me read his history books sep [laughter] he made the mistake of teaching me that patrick henry was a patriot, and george washington sep wasn't nothing non-violent about ol' pat, or george washington sep "liberty or death" is was what brought about the freedom of whites in this country from the english sep [applause]they didn't care about the odds sep why, they faced the wrath of the entire british empire sep and in those days, they used to say that the british empire was so vast and so powerful that the sun would never set on it sep this is how big it was, yet these thirteen little scrawny states, tired of taxation without representation, tired of being exploited and oppressed and degraded, told that big british empire, "liberty or death sep " and here you have 22 million afro-americans, black people today, catching more hell than patrick henry ever saw sep [applause]and i'm here to tell you in case you don't know it  that you got a new, you got a new generation of black people in this country who don't care anything whatsoever about odds sep they don't want to hear you ol' uncle tom, handkerchief-heads talking about the odds sep no sep [laughter, applause] this is a new generation sep if they're going to draft these young black men, and send them over to korea or to south vietnam to face 800 million chinese& [laughter, applause] if you're not afraid of those odds, you shouldn't be afraid of these odds sep [applause]why is america  why does this loom to be such an explosive political year sep because this is the year of politics sep this is the year when all of the white politicians are going to come into the negro community sep you never see them until election time sep you can't find them until election time sep [applause] they're going to come in with false promises sep and as they make these false promises they're going to feed our frustrations, and this will only serve to make matters worse sep i'm no politician sep i'm not even a student of politics sep i'm not a republican, nor a democrat, nor an american sep and got sense enough to know it sep [applause]i'm one of the 22 million black victims of the democrats sep one of the 22 million black victims of the republicans and one of the 22 million black victims of americanism sep [applause] and when i speak, i don't speak as a democrat or a republican, nor an american sep i speak as a victim of america's so-called democracy sep you and i have never seen democracy sep all we've seen is hypocrisy sep [applause]when we open our eyes today and look around america, we see america not through the eyes of someone who has enjoyed the fruits of americanism sep we see america through the eyes of someone who has been the victim of americanism sep we don't see any american dream sep we've experienced only the american nightmare sep we haven't benefited from america's democracy sep we've only suffered from america's hypocrisy sep and the generation that's coming up now can see it sep and are not afraid to say it sep if you go to jail, so what sep if you're black, you were born in jail sep [applause]if you black you were born in jail, in the north as well as the south sep stop talking about the south sep as long as you south of the canadian border, you south sep [laughter, applause] don't call governor wallace a dixie governor, romney is a dixie governor sep [applause]twenty-two million black victims of americanism are waking up and they are gaining a new political consciousness, becoming politically mature sep and as they become sep develop this political maturity, they're able to see the recent trends in these political elections sep they see that the whites are so evenly divided that every time they vote, the race is so close they have to go back and count the votes all over again sep which means that any block, any minority that has a block of votes that stick together is in a strategic position sep either way you go, that's who gets it sep you're in a position to determine who'll go to the white house and who'll stay in the doghouse sep [laughter]you're the one who has that power sep you can keep johnson in washington d sep c sep , or you can send him back to his texas cotton patch sep [applause] you're the one who sent kennedy to washington sep you're the one who put the present democratic administration in washington, d sep c sep the whites were evenly divided sep it was the fact that you threw 80 percent of your votes behind the democrats that put the democrats in the white house sep when you see this, you can see that the negro vote is the key factor sep and despite the fact that you are in a position to be the determining factor, what do you get out of it sep the democrats have been in washington, d sep c sep only because of the negro vote sep they've been down there four years sep and they're sep all other legislation they wanted to bring up they've brought it up, and gotten it out of the way, and now they bring up you sep and now they bring up you sep you put them first and they put you last sep because you're a chump sep [applause] a political chump sep in washington, d sep c sep , in the house of representatives there are 257 who are democrats sep only 177 are republican sep in the senate there are 67 democrats sep only 33 are republicans sep the party that you backed controls two-thirds of the house of representatives and the senate and still they can't keep their promise to you sep 'cause you're a chump sep [applause]any time you throw your weight behind a political party that controls two-thirds of the government, and that party can't keep the promise that it made to you during election-time, and you're dumb enough to walk around continuing to identify yourself with that party, you're not only a chump but you're a traitor to your race sep [applause]what kind of alibi do come up with sep they try and pass the buck to the dixiecrats sep now, back during the days when you were blind, deaf and dumb, ignorant, politically immature, naturally you went along with that sep but today, as your eyes come open, and you develop political maturity, you're able to see and think for yourself, and you can see that a dixiecrat is nothing but a democrat sep in disguise sep [applause]you look at the structure of the government that controls this country, is controlled by 16 senatorial committees and 20 congressional committees sep of the 16 senatorial committees that run the government, 10 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists sep of the 20 congressional committees that run the government, 12 of them are in the hands of southern segregationists sep and they're going to tell you and me that the south lost the war sep [laughter, applause]you, today, are in the hands of a government of segregationists sep racists, white supremacists, who belong to the democratic party but disguise themselves as dixiecrats sep a dixiecrat is nothing but a democrat sep whoever runs the democrats is also the father of the dixiecrats sep and the father of all of them is sitting in the white house sep [applause] i say, and i'll say it again, you got a president who's nothing but a southern segregationist [applause] from the state of texas sep they'll lynch in texas as quick as they'll lynch you in mississippi sep only in texas they lynch you with a texas accent, in mississippi they lynch you with a mississippi accent sep [cheering]the first thing the cracker does when he comes in power, he takes all the negro leaders and invites them for coffee sep to show that he's all right sep and those uncle toms can't pass up the coffee sep [laughter, applause] they come away from the coffee table telling you and me that this man is all right [laughter] sep 'cause he's from the south and since he's from the south he can deal with the south sep look at the logic that they're using sep what about eastland sep he's from the south sep why not make him the president sep if johnson is a good man 'cause he's from texas, and being from texas will enable him to deal with the south, eastland can deal with the south better than johnson sep [laughter, applause]oh, i say you been misled sep you been had sep you been took sep [laughter, applause] i was in washington a couple of weeks ago while the senators were filibustering and i noticed in the back of the senate a huge map, and on this map it showed the distribution of negroes in america sep and surprisingly, the same senators that were involved in the filibuster were from the states where there were the most negroes sep why were they filibustering the civil rights legislation sep because the civil rights legislation is supposed to guarantee boarding rights to negroes from those states sep and those senators from those states know that if the negroes in those states can vote, those senators are down the drain sep [applause] the representatives of those states go down the drain sep and in the constitution of this country it has a stipulation, wherein, whenever the rights, the voting rights of people in a certain district are violated, then the representative who's from that particular district, according to the constitution, is supposed to be expelled from the congress sep now, if this particular aspect of the constitution was enforced, why, you wouldn't have a cracker in washington, d sep c sep [applause]but what would happen" when you expel the dixiecrat, you're expelling the democrat sep when you destroy the power of the dixiecrat, you are destroying the power of the democratic party sep so how in the world can the democratic party in the south actually side with you, in sincerity, when all of its power is based in the south sep these northern democrats are in cahoots with the southern democrats sep [applause] they're playing a giant con game, a political con game sep you know how it goes sep one of 'em comes to you and make believe he's for you sep and he's in cahoots with the other one that's not for you sep why sep because neither one of 'em is for you sep but they got to make you go with one of 'em or the other sep so this is a con game, and this is what they've been doing with you and me all of these years sep first thing, johnson got off the plane when he become president, he ask, "where's dickey sep " you know who dickey is sep dickey is old southern cracker richard russell sep lookie here sep yes, lyndon b sep johnson's best friend is the one who is a head, who's heading the forces that are filibustering civil rights legislation sep you tell me how in the hell is he going to be johnson's best friend sep [applause] how can johnson be his friend and your friend too sep no, that man is too tricky sep especially if his friend is still ol' dickey sep [laughter, applause]whenever the negroes keep the democrats in power they're keeping the dixiecrats in power sep this is true sep a vote for a democrat is nothing but a vote for a dixiecrat sep i know you don't like me saying that sep i'm not the kind of person who come here to say what you like sep i'm going to tell you the truth whether you like it or not sep [applause]up here in the north you have the same thing sep the democratic party don't sep they don't do it that way sep they got a thing they call gerrymandering sep they maneuver you out of power sep even though you can vote they fix it so you're voting for nobody sep they got you going and coming sep in the south they're outright political wolves, in the north they're political foxes sep a fox and a wolf are both canine, both belong to the dog family sep [laughter, applause] now, you take your choice sep you going to choose a northern dog or a southern dog sep because either dog you choose, i guarantee you, you'll still be in the doghouse sep this is why i say it's the ballot or the bullet sep it's liberty or it's death sep it's freedom for everybody or freedom for nobody sep [applause] america today finds herself in a unique situation sep historically, revolutions are bloody, oh yes they are sep they have never had a bloodless revolution sep or a non-violent revolution sep that don't happen even in hollywood [laughter] you don't have a revolution in which you love your enemy sep and you don't have a revolution in which you are begging the system of exploitation to integrate you into it sep revolutions overturn systems sep revolutions destroy systems sep a revolution is bloody, but america is in a unique position sep she's the only country in history, in the position actually to become involved in a bloodless revolution sep the russian revolution was bloody, chinese revolution was bloody, french revolution was bloody, cuban revolution was bloody sep and there was nothing more bloody than the american revolution sep but today, this country can become involved in a revolution that won't take bloodshed sep all she's got to do is give the black man in this country everything that's due him, everything sep [applause]i hope that the white man can see this sep 'cause if you don't see it you're finished sep if you don't see it you're going to become involved in some action in which you don't have a chance sep we don't care anything about your atomic bomb; it's useless, because other countries have atomic bombs sep when two or three different countries have atomic bombs, nobody can use them sep so it means that the white man today is without a weapon sep if you want some action you've got to come on down to earth, and there's more black people on earth than there are white people sep [applause]i only got a couple more minutes sep the white man can never win another war on the ground sep his days of war sep victory sep his days of battleground victory are over sep can i prove it sep yes sep take
ESFP	ladies and gentlemen, i'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the union, but the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans sep today is a day for mourning and remembering sep nancy and i are pained to the core by the tragedy of the shuttle challenger sep we know we share this pain with all of the people of our country sep this is truly a national loss sep nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground sep but we've never lost an astronaut in flight sep we've never had a tragedy like this sep and perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle sep but they, the challenger seven, were aware of the dangers, but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly sep we mourn seven heroes: michael smith, dick scobee, judith resnik, ronald mcnair, ellison onizuka, gregory jarvis, and christa mcauliffe sep we mourn their loss as a nation together sep for the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the full impact of this tragedy sep but we feel the loss, and we're thinking about you so very much sep your loved ones were daring and brave, and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, "give me a challenge, and i'll meet it with joy sep " they had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths sep they wished to serve, and they did sep they served all of us sep we've grown used to wonders in this century sep it's hard to dazzle us sep but for twenty-five years the united states space program has been doing just that sep we've grown used to the idea of space, and, perhaps we forget that we've only just begun sep we're still pioneers sep they, the members of the challenger crew, were pioneers sep and i want to say something to the schoolchildren of america who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's take-off sep i know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen sep it's all part of the process of exploration and discovery sep it's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons sep the future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave sep the challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them sep i've always had great faith in and respect for our space program sep and what happened today does nothing to diminish it sep we don't hide our space program sep we don't keep secrets and cover things up sep we do it all up front and in public sep that's the way freedom is, and we wouldn't change it for a minute sep we'll continue our quest in space sep there will be more shuttle flights and more shuttle crews and, yes, more volunteers, more civilians, more teachers in space sep nothing ends here; our hopes and our journeys continue sep i want to add that i wish i could talk to every man and woman who works for nasa, or who worked on this mission and tell them: "your dedication and professionalism have moved and impressed us for decades sep and we know of your anguish sep we share it sep "there's a coincidence today sep on this day three hundred and ninety years ago, the great explorer sir francis drake died aboard ship off the coast of panama sep in his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian later said, "he lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in it sep " well, today, we can say of the challenger crew: their dedication was, like drake's, complete sep the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives sep we will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for their journey and waved goodbye and "slipped the surly bonds of earth" to "touch the face of god sep "1thank you
ESFP	reverend meza, reverend reck, i'm grateful for your generous invitation to state my views sep while the so-called religious issue is necessarily and properly the chief topic here tonight, i want to emphasize from the outset that i believe that we have far more critical issues in the 1960 campaign; the spread of communist influence, until it now festers only 90 miles from the coast of florida -- the humiliating treatment of our president and vice president by those who no longer respect our power -- the hungry children i saw in west virginia, the old people who cannot pay their doctors bills, the families forced to give up their farms -- an america with too many slums, with too few schools, and too late to the moon and outer space sep these are the real issues which should decide this campaign sep and they are not religious issues -- for war and hunger and ignorance and despair know no religious barrier sep but because i am a catholic, and no catholic has ever been elected president, the real issues in this campaign have been obscured -- perhaps deliberately, in some quarters less responsible than this sep so it is apparently necessary for me to state once again -- not what kind of church i believe in, for that should be important only to me -- but what kind of america i believe in sep i believe in an america where the separation of church and state is absolute; where no catholic prelate would tell the president -- should he be catholic -- how to act, and no protestant minister would tell his parishioners for whom to vote; where no church or church school is granted any public funds or political preference, and where no man is denied public office merely because his religion differs from the president who might appoint him, or the people who might elect him sep i believe in an america that is officially neither catholic, protestant nor jewish; where no public official either requests or accept instructions on public policy from the pope, the national council of churches or any other ecclesiastical source; where no religious body seeks to impose its will directly or indirectly upon the general populace or the public acts of its officials, and where religious liberty is so indivisible that an act against one church is treated as an act against all sep for while this year it may be a catholic against whom the finger of suspicion is pointed, in other years it has been -- and may someday be again -- a jew, or a quaker, or a unitarian, or a baptist sep it was virginia's harassment of baptist preachers, for example, that led to jefferson's statute of religious freedom sep today, i may be the victim, but tomorrow it may be you -- until the whole fabric of our harmonious society is ripped apart at a time of great national peril sep finally, i believe in an america where religious intolerance will someday end, where all men and all churches are treated as equals, where every man has the same right to attend or not to attend the church of his choice, where there is no catholic vote, no anti-catholic vote, no bloc voting of any kind, and where catholics, protestants, and jews, at both the lay and the pastoral levels, will refrain from those attitudes of disdain and division which have so often marred their works in the past, and promote instead the american ideal of brotherhood sep that is the kind of america in which i believe sep and it represents the kind of presidency in which i believe, a great office that must be neither humbled by making it the instrument of any religious group nor tarnished by arbitrarily withholding it -- its occupancy from the members of any one religious group sep i believe in a president whose views on religion are his own private affair, neither imposed upon him by the nation, nor imposed by the nation upon him as a condition to holding that office sep i would not look with favor upon a president working to subvert the first amendment's guarantees of religious liberty; nor would our system of checks and balances permit him to do so sep and neither do i look with favor upon those who would work to subvert article vi of the constitution by requiring a religious test, even by indirection sep for if they disagree with that safeguard, they should be openly working to repeal it sep i want a chief executive whose public acts are responsible to all and obligated to none, who can attend any ceremony, service, or dinner his office may appropriately require of him to fulfill; and whose fulfillment of his presidential office is not limited or conditioned by any religious oath, ritual, or "ligation sep this is the kind of america i believe in -- and this is the kind of america i fought for in the south pacific, and the kind my brother died for in europe sep no one suggested then that we might have a divided loyalty, that we did not believe in liberty, or that we belonged to a disloyal group that threatened -- i quote -- "the freedoms for which our forefathers died sep "and in fact this is the kind of america for which our forefathers did die when they fled here to escape religious test oaths that denied office to members of less favored churches -- when they fought for the constitution, the bill of rights, the virginia statute of religious freedom -- and when they fought at the shrine i visited today, the alamo sep for side by side with bowie and crockett died fuentes, and mccafferty, and bailey, and badillo, and carey -- but no one knows whether they were catholics or not sep for there was no religious test there sep i ask you tonight to follow in that tradition -- to judge me on the basis of 14 years in the congress, on my declared stands against an ambassador to the vatican, against unconstitutional aid to parochial schools, and against any boycott of the public schools -- which i attended myself sep and instead of doing this, do not judge me on the basis of these pamphlets and publications we all have seen that carefully select quotations out of context from the statements of catholic church leaders, usually in other countries, frequently in other centuries, and rarely relevant to any situation here sep and always omitting, of course, the statement of the american bishops in 1948 which strongly endorsed church-state separation, and which more nearly reflects the views of almost every american catholic sep i do not consider these other quotations binding upon my public acts sep why should you sep but let me say, with respect to other countries, that i am wholly opposed to the state being used by any religious group, catholic or protestant, to compel, prohibit, or prosecute the free exercise of any other religion sep and that goes for any persecution, at any time, by anyone, in any country sep and i hope that you and i condemn with equal fervor those nations which deny their presidency to protestants, and those which deny it to catholics sep and rather than cite the misdeeds of those who differ, i would also cite the record of the catholic church in such nations as france and ireland, and the independence of such statesmen as de gaulle and adenauer sep but let me stress again that these are my views sep for contrary to common newspaper usage, i am not the catholic candidate for president sep i am the democratic party's candidate for president who happens also to be a catholic sep i do not speak for my church on public matters; and the church does not speak for me sep whatever issue may come before me as president, if i should be elected, on birth control, divorce, censorship, gambling or any other subject, i will make my decision in accordance with these views -- in accordance with what my conscience tells me to be in the national interest, and without regard to outside religious pressure or dictates sep and no power or threat of punishment could cause me to decide otherwise sep but if the time should ever come -- and i do not concede any conflict to be remotely possible -- when my office would require me to either violate my conscience or violate the national interest, then i would resign the office; and i hope any conscientious public servant would do likewise sep but i do not intend to apologize for these views to my critics of either catholic or protestant faith; nor do i intend to disavow either my views or my church in order to win this election sep if i should lose on the real issues, i shall return to my seat in the senate, satisfied that i'd tried my best and was fairly judged sep but if this election is decided on the basis that 40 million americans lost their chance of being president on the day they were baptized, then it is the whole nation that will be the loser, in the eyes of catholics and non-catholics around the world, in the eyes of history, and in the eyes of our own people sep but if, on the other hand, i should win this election, then i shall devote every effort of mind and spirit to fulfilling the oath of the
ESTJ	mr sep speaker, mr sep president, members of the congress: i speak tonight for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy sep i urge every member of both parties, americans of all religions and of all colors, from every section of this country, to join me in that cause sep at times history and fate meet at a single time in a single place to shape a turning point in man's unending search for freedom sep so it was at lexington and concord sep so it was a century ago at appomattox sep so it was last week in selma, alabama sep there, long-suffering men and women peacefully protested the denial of their rights as americans sep many were brutally assaulted sep one good man, a man of god, was killed sep there is no cause for pride in what has happened in selma sep there is no cause for self-satisfaction in the long denial of equal rights of millions of americans sep but there is cause for hope and for faith in our democracy in what is happening here tonight sep for the cries of pain and the hymns and protests of oppressed people have summoned into convocation all the majesty of this great government -- the government of the greatest nation on earth sep our mission is at once the oldest and the most basic of this country: to right wrong, to do justice, to serve man sep in our time we have come to live with the moments of great crisis sep our lives have been marked with debate about great issues -- issues of war and peace, issues of prosperity and depression sep but rarely in any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself sep rarely are we met with a challenge, not to our growth or abundance, or our welfare or our security, but rather to the values, and the purposes, and the meaning of our beloved nation sep the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue sep and should we defeat every enemy, and should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue, then we will have failed as a people and as a nation sep for with a country as with a person, "what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul sep "there is no negro problem sep there is no southern problem sep there is no northern problem sep there is only an american problem sep and we are met here tonight as americans -- not as democrats or republicans sep we are met here as americans to solve that problem sep this was the first nation in the history of the world to be founded with a purpose sep the great phrases of that purpose still sound in every american heart, north and south: "all men are created equal," "government by consent of the governed," "give me liberty or give me death sep " well, those are not just clever words, or those are not just empty theories sep in their name americans have fought and died for two centuries, and tonight around the world they stand there as guardians of our liberty, risking their lives sep those words are a promise to every citizen that he shall share in the dignity of man sep this dignity cannot be found in a man's possessions; it cannot be found in his power, or in his position sep it really rests on his right to be treated as a man equal in opportunity to all others sep it says that he shall share in freedom, he shall choose his leaders, educate his children, provide for his family according to his ability and his merits as a human being sep to apply any other test -- to deny a man his hopes because of his color, or race, or his religion, or the place of his birth is not only to do injustice, it is to deny america and to dishonor the dead who gave their lives for american freedom sep our fathers believed that if this noble view of the rights of man was to flourish, it must be rooted in democracy sep the most basic right of all was the right to choose your own leaders sep the history of this country, in large measure, is the history of the expansion of that right to all of our people sep many of the issues of civil rights are very complex and most difficult sep but about this there can and should be no argument sep every american citizen must have an equal right to vote sep there is no reason which can excuse the denial of that right sep there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right sep yet the harsh fact is that in many places in this country men and women are kept from voting simply because they are negroes sep every device of which human ingenuity is capable has been used to deny this right sep the negro citizen may go to register only to be told that the day is wrong, or the hour is late, or the official in charge is absent sep and if he persists, and if he manages to present himself to the registrar, he may be disqualified because he did not spell out his middle name or because he abbreviated a word on the application sep and if he manages to fill out an application, he is given a test sep the registrar is the sole judge of whether he passes this test sep he may be asked to recite the entire constitution, or explain the most complex provisions of state law sep and even a college degree cannot be used to prove that he can read and write sep for the fact is that the only way to pass these barriers is to show a white skin sep experience has clearly shown that the existing process of law cannot overcome systematic and ingenious discrimination sep no law that we now have on the books -- and i have helped to put three of them there -- can ensure the right to vote when local officials are determined to deny it sep in such a case our duty must be clear to all of us sep the constitution says that no person shall be kept from voting because of his race or his color sep we have all sworn an oath before god to support and to defend that constitution sep we must now act in obedience to that oath sep wednesday, i will send to congress a law designed to eliminate illegal barriers to the right to vote sep the broad principles of that bill will be in the hands of the democratic and republican leaders tomorrow sep after they have reviewed it, it will come here formally as a bill sep i am grateful for this opportunity to come here tonight at the invitation of the leadership to reason with my friends, to give them my views, and to visit with my former colleagues sep i've had prepared a more comprehensive analysis of the legislation which i had intended to transmit to the clerk tomorrow, but which i will submit to the clerks tonight sep but i want to really discuss with you now, briefly, the main proposals of this legislation sep this bill will strike down restrictions to voting in all elections -- federal, state, and local -- which have been used to deny negroes the right to vote sep this bill will establish a simple, uniform standard which cannot be used, however ingenious the effort, to flout our constitution sep it will provide for citizens to be registered by officials of the united states government, if the state officials refuse to register them sep it will eliminate tedious, unnecessary lawsuits which delay the right to vote sep finally, this legislation will ensure that properly registered individuals are not prohibited from voting sep i will welcome the suggestions from all of the members of congress -- i have no doubt that i will get some -- on ways and means to strengthen this law and to make it effective sep but experience has plainly shown that this is the only path to carry out the command of the constitution sep to those who seek to avoid action by their national government in their own communities, who want to and who seek to maintain purely local control over elections, the answer is simple: open your polling places to all your people sep allow men and women to register and vote whatever the color of their skin sep extend the rights of citizenship to every citizen of this land sep there is no constitutional issue here sep the command of the constitution is plain sep there is no moral issue sep it is wrong -- deadly wrong -- to deny any of your fellow americans the right to vote in this country sep there is no issue of states' rights or national rights sep there is only the struggle for human rights sep i have not the slightest doubt what will be your answer sep but the last time a president sent a civil rights bill to the congress, it contained a provision to protect voting rights in federal elections sep that civil rights bill was passed after eight long months of debate sep and when that bill came to my desk from the congress for my signature, the heart of the voting provision had been eliminated sep this time, on this issue, there must be no delay, or no hesitation, or no compromise with our purpose sep we cannot, we must not, refuse to protect the right of every american to vote in every election that he may desire to participate in sep and we ought not, and we cannot, and we must not wait another eight months before we get a bill sep we have already waited a hundred years and more, and the time for waiting is gone sep so i ask you to join me in working long hours -- nights and weekends, if necessary -- to pass this bill sep and i don't make that request lightly sep for from the window where i sit with the problems of our country, i recognize that from outside this chamber is the outraged conscience of a nation, the grave concern of many nations, and the harsh judgment of history on our acts sep but even if we pass this bill, the battle will not be over sep what happened in selma is part of a far larger movement which reaches into every section and state of america sep it is the effort of american negroes to secure for themselves the full blessings of american life sep their cause must be our cause too sep because it's not just negroes, but really it's all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice sep and we shall overcome sep as a man whose roots go deeply into southern soil, i know how agonizing racial feelings are sep i know how difficult it is to reshape the attitudes and the structure of our society sep but a century has passed, more than a hundred years since the negro was freed sep and he is not fully free tonight sep it was more than a hundred years ago that abraham lincoln, a great president of another party, signed the emancipation proclamation; but emancipation is a proclamation, and not a fact sep a century has passed, more than a hundred years, since equality was promised sep and yet the negro is not equal sep a century has passed since the day of promise sep and the promise is un-kept sep the time of justice has now come sep i tell you that i believe sincerely that no force can hold it back sep it is right in the eyes of man and god that it should come sep and when it does, i think that day will brighten the lives of every american sep for negroes are not the only victims sep how many white children have gone uneducated sep how many white families have lived in stark poverty sep how many white lives have been scarred by fear, because we've wasted our energy and our substance to maintain the barriers of hatred and terror sep and so i say to all of you here, and to all in the nation tonight, that those who appeal to you to hold on to the past do so at the cost of denying you your future sep this great, rich, restless country can offer opportunity and education and hope to all, all black and white, all north and south, sharecropper and city dweller sep these are the enemies: poverty, ignorance, disease sep they're our enemies, not our fellow man, not our neighbor sep and these enemies too -- poverty, disease, and ignorance: we shall overcome sep now let none of us in any section look with prideful righteousness on the troubles in another section, or the problems of our neighbors sep there's really no part of america where the promise of equality has been fully kept sep in buffalo as well as in birmingham, in philadelphia as well as selma, americans are struggling for the fruits of freedom sep this is one nation sep what happens in selma or in cincinnati is a matter of legitimate concern to every american sep but let each of us look within our own hearts and our own communities, and let each of us put our shoulder to the wheel to root out injustice wherever it exists sep as we meet here in this peaceful, historic chamber tonight, men from the south, some of whom were at iwo jima, men from the north who have carried old glory to far corners of the world and brought it back without a stain on it, men from the east and from the west, are all fighting together without regard to religion, or color, or region, in vietnam sep men from every region fought for us across the world twenty years ago sep and now in these common dangers and these common sacrifices, the south made its contribution of honor and gallantry no less than any other region in the great republic -- and in some instances, a great many of them, more sep and i have not the slightest doubt that good men from everywhere in this country, from the great lakes to the gulf of mexico, from the golden gate to the harbors along the atlantic, will rally now together in this cause to vindicate the freedom of all americans sep for all of us owe this duty; and i believe that all of us will respond to it sep your president makes that request of every american sep the real hero of this struggle is the american negro sep his actions and protests, his courage to risk safety and even to risk his life, have awakened the conscience of this nation sep his demonstrations have been designed to call attention to injustice, designed to provoke change, designed to stir reform sep he has called upon us to make good the promise of america sep and who among us can say that we would have made the same progress were it not for his persistent bravery, and his faith in american democracy sep for at the real heart of battle for equality is a deep seated belief in the democratic process sep equality depends not on the force of arms or tear gas but depends upon the force of moral right; not on recourse to violence but on respect for law and order sep and there have been many pressures upon your president and there will be others as the days come and go sep but i pledge you tonight that we intend to fight this battle where it should be fought -- in the courts, and in the congress, and in the hearts of men sep we must preserve the right of free speech and the right of free assembly sep but the right of free speech does not carry with it, as has been said, the right to holler fire in a crowded theater sep we must preserve the right to free assembly sep but free assembly does not carry with it the right to block public thoroughfares to traffic sep we do have a right to protest, and a right to march under conditions that do not infringe the constitutional rights of our neighbors sep and i intend to protect all those rights as long as i am permitted to serve in this office sep we will guard against violence, knowing it strikes from our hands the very weapons which we seek: progress, obedience to law, and belief in american values sep in selma, as elsewhere, we seek and pray for peace sep we seek order sep we seek unity sep but we will not accept the peace of stifled rights, or the order imposed by fear, or the unity that stifles protest sep for peace cannot be purchased at the cost of liberty sep in selma tonight -- and we had a good day there -- as in every city, we are working for a just and peaceful settlement and we must all remember that after this speech i am making tonight, after the police and the fbi and the marshals have all gone, and after you have promptly passed this bill, the people of selma and the other cities of the nation must still live and work together sep and when the attention of the nation has gone elsewhere, they must try to heal the wounds and to build a new community sep this cannot be easily done on a battleground of violence, as the history of the south itself shows sep it is in recognition of this that men of both races have shown such an outstandingly impressive responsibility in recent days -- last tuesday, again today sep the bill that i am presenting to you will be known as a civil rights bill sep but, in a larger sense, most of the program i am recommending is a civil rights program sep its object is to open the city of hope to all people of all races sep because all americans just must have the right to vote sep and we are going to give them that right sep all americans must have the privileges of citizenship -- regardless of race sep and they are going to have those privileges of citizenship -- regardless of race sep but i would like to caution you and remind you that to exercise these privileges takes much more than just legal right sep it requires a trained mind and a healthy body sep it requires a decent home, and the chance to find a job, and the opportunity to escape from the clutches of poverty sep of course, people cannot contribute to the nation if they are never taught to read or write, if their bodies are stunted from hunger, if their sickness goes untended, if their life is spent in hopeless poverty just drawing a welfare check sep so we want to open the gates to opportunity sep but we're also going to give all our people, black and white, the help that they need to walk through those gates sep my first job after college was as a teacher in cotulla, texas, in a small mexican-american school sep few of them could speak english, and i couldn't speak much spanish sep my students were poor and they often came to class without breakfast, hungry sep and they knew, even in their youth, the pain of prejudice sep they never seemed to know why people disliked them sep but they knew it was so, because i saw it in their eyes sep i often walked home late in the afternoon, after the classes were finished, wishing there was more that i could do sep but all i knew was to teach them the little that i knew, hoping that it might help them against the hardships that lay ahead sep and somehow you never forget what poverty and hatred can do when you see its scars on the hopeful face of a young child sep i never thought then, in 1928, that i would be standing here in 1965 sep it never even occurred to me in my fondest dreams that i might have the chance to help the sons and daughters of those students and to help people like them all over this country sep but now i do have that chance -- and i'll let you in on a secret -- i mean to use it sep and i hope that you will use it with me sep this is the richest and the most powerful country which ever occupied this globe sep the might of past empires is little compared to ours sep but i do not want to be the president who built empires, or sought grandeur, or extended dominion sep i want to be the president who educated young children to the wonders of their world sep i want to be the president who helped to feed the hungry and to prepare them to be tax-payers instead of tax-eaters sep i want to be the president who helped the poor to find their own way and who protected the right of every citizen to vote in every election sep i want to be the president who helped to end hatred among his fellow men, and who promoted love among the people of all races and all regions and all parties sep i want to be the president who helped to end war among the brothers of this earth sep and so, at the request of your beloved speaker, and the senator from montana, the majority leader, the senator from illinois, the minority leader, mr sep mcculloch, and other members of both parties, i came here tonight -- not as president roosevelt came down one time, in person, to veto a bonus bill, not as president truman came down one time to urge the passage of a railroad bill -- but i came down here to ask you to share this task with me, and to share it with the people that we both work for sep i want this to be the congress, republicans and democrats alike, which did all these things for all these people sep beyond this great chamber, out yonder in fifty states, are the people that we serve sep who can tell what deep and unspoken hopes are in their hearts tonight as they sit there and listen sep we all can guess, from our own lives, how difficult they often find their own pursuit of happiness, how many problems each little family has sep they look most of all to themselves for their futures sep but i think that they also look to each of us sep above the pyramid on the great seal of the united states it says in latin: "god has favored our undertaking sep " god will not favor everything that we do sep it is rather our duty to divine his will sep but i cannot help believing that he truly understands and that he really favors the undertaking that we begin here tonight
ISTJ	tonight we come together bound by our faith in a mighty god, with genuine respect and love for our country, and inheriting the legacy of a great party, the democratic party, which is the best hope for redirecting our nation on a more humane, just, and peaceful course sep this is not a perfect party sep we are not a perfect people sep yet, we are called to a perfect mission sep our mission: to feed the hungry; to clothe the naked; to house the homeless; to teach the illiterate; to provide jobs for the jobless; and to choose the human race over the nuclear race sep we are gathered here this week to nominate a candidate and adopt a platform which will expand, unify, direct, and inspire our party and the nation to fulfill this mission sep my constituency is the desperate, the damned, the disinherited, the disrespected, and the despised sep they are restless and seek relief sep they have voted in record numbers sep they have invested the faith, hope, and trust that they have in us sep the democratic party must send them a signal that we care sep i pledge my best not to let them down sep there is the call of conscience, redemption, expansion, healing, and unity sep leadership must heed the call of conscience, redemption, expansion, healing, and unity, for they are the key to achieving our mission sep time is neutral and does not change things sep with courage and initiative, leaders change things sep no generation can choose the age or circumstance in which it is born, but through leadership it can choose to make the age in which it is born an age of enlightenment, an age of jobs, and peace, and justice sep only leadership -- that intangible combination of gifts, the discipline, information, circumstance, courage, timing, will and divine inspiration -- can lead us out of the crisis in which we find ourselves sep leadership can mitigate the misery of our nation sep leadership can part the waters and lead our nation in the direction of the promised land sep leadership can lift the boats stuck at the bottom sep i have had the rare opportunity to watch seven men, and then two, pour out their souls, offer their service, and heal and heed the call of duty to direct the course of our nation sep there is a proper season for everything sep there is a time to sow and a time to reap sep there's a time to compete and a time to cooperate sep i ask for your vote on the first ballot as a vote for a new direction for this party and this nation -- a vote of conviction, a vote of conscience sep but i will be proud to support the nominee of this convention for the presidency of the united states of america sep thank you sep i have watched the leadership of our party develop and grow sep my respect for both mr sep mondale and mr sep hart is great sep i have watched them struggle with the crosswinds and crossfires of being public servants, and i believe they will both continue to try to serve us faithfully sep i am elated by the knowledge that for the first time in our history a woman, geraldine ferraro, will be recommended to share our ticket sep throughout this campaign, i've tried to offer leadership to the democratic party and the nation sep if, in my high moments, i have done some good, offered some service, shed some light, healed some wounds, rekindled some hope, or stirred someone from apathy and indifference, or in any way along the way helped somebody, then this campaign has not been in vain sep for friends who loved and cared for me, and for a god who spared me, and for a family who understood, i am eternally grateful sep if, in my low moments, in word, deed or attitude, through some error of temper, taste, or tone, i have caused anyone discomfort, created pain, or revived someone's fears, that was not my truest self sep if there were occasions when my grape turned into a raisin and my joy bell lost its resonance, please forgive me sep charge it to my head and not to my heart sep my head -- so limited in its finitude; my heart, which is boundless in its love for the human family sep i am not a perfect servant sep i am a public servant doing my best against the odds sep as i develop and serve, be patient: god is not finished with me yet sep this campaign has taught me much; that leaders must be tough enough to fight, tender enough to cry, human enough to make mistakes, humble enough to admit them, strong enough to absorb the pain, and resilient enough to bounce back and keep on moving sep for leaders, the pain is often intense sep but you must smile through your tears and keep moving with the faith that there is a brighter side somewhere sep i went to see hubert humphrey three days before he died sep he had just called richard nixon from his dying bed, and many people wondered why sep and i asked him sep he said, "jesse, from this vantage point, the sun is setting in my life, all of the speeches, the political conventions, the crowds, and the great fights are behind me now sep at a time like this you are forced to deal with your irreducible essence, forced to grapple with that which is really important to you sep and what i've concluded about life," hubert humphrey said, "when all is said and done, we must forgive each other, and redeem each other, and move on sep "our party is emerging from one of its most hard fought battles for the democratic party's presidential nomination in our history sep but our healthy competition should make us better, not bitter sep we must use the insight, wisdom, and experience of the late hubert humphrey as a balm for the wounds in our party, this nation, and the world sep we must forgive each other, redeem each other, regroup, and move one sep our flag is red, white and blue, but our nation is a rainbow -- red, yellow, brown, black and white -- and we're all precious in god's sight sep america is not like a blanket -- one piece of unbroken cloth, the same color, the same texture, the same size sep america is more like a quilt: many patches, many pieces, many colors, many sizes, all woven and held together by a common thread sep the white, the hispanic, the black, the arab, the jew, the woman, the native american, the small farmer, the businessperson, the environmentalist, the peace activist, the young, the old, the lesbian, the gay, and the disabled make up the american quilt sep even in our fractured state, all of us count and fit somewhere sep we have proven that we can survive without each other sep but we have not proven that we can win and make progress without each other sep we must come together sep from fannie lou hamer in atlantic city in 1964 to the rainbow coalition in san francisco today; from the atlantic to the pacific, we have experienced pain but progress, as we ended american apartheid laws sep we got public accommodations sep we secured voting rights sep we obtained open housing, as young people got the right to vote sep we lost malcolm, martin, medgar, bobby, john, and viola sep the team that got us here must be expanded, not abandoned sep twenty years ago, tears welled up in our eyes as the bodies of schwerner, goodman, and chaney were dredged from the depths of a river in mississippi sep twenty years later, our communities, black and jewish, are in anguish, anger, and pain sep feelings have been hurt on both sides sep there is a crisis in communications sep confusion is in the air sep but we cannot afford to lose our way sep we may agree to agree; or agree to disagree on issues; we must bring back civility to these tensions sep we are co-partners in a long and rich religious history -- the judeo-christian traditions sep many blacks and jews have a shared passion for social justice at home and peace abroad sep we must seek a revival of the spirit, inspired by a new vision and new possibilities sep we must return to higher ground sep we are bound by moses and jesus, but also connected with islam and mohammed sep these three great religions, judaism, christianity, and islam, were all born in the revered and holy city of jerusalem sep we are bound by dr sep martin luther king jr sep and rabbi abraham heschel, crying out from their graves for us to reach common ground sep we are bound by shared blood and shared sacrifices sep we are much too intelligent, much too bound by our judeo-christian heritage, much too victimized by racism, sexism, militarism, and anti-semitism, much too threatened as historical scapegoats to go on divided one from another sep we must turn from finger pointing to clasped hands sep we must share our burdens and our joys with each other once again sep we must turn to each other and not on each other and choose higher ground sep twenty years later, we cannot be satisfied by just restoring the old coalition sep old wine skins must make room for new wine sep we must heal and expand sep the rainbow coalition is making room for arab americans sep they, too, know the pain and hurt of racial and religious rejection sep they must not continue to be made pariahs sep the rainbow coalition is making room for hispanic americans who this very night are living under the threat of the simpson-mazzoli bill; and farm workers from ohio who are fighting the campbell soup company with a boycott to achieve legitimate workers' rights sep the rainbow is making room for the native american, the most exploited people of all, a people with the greatest moral claim amongst us sep we support them as they seek the restoration of their ancient land and claim amongst us sep we support them as they seek the restoration of land and water rights, as they seek to preserve their ancestral homeland and the beauty of a land that was once all theirs sep they can never receive a fair share for all they have given us sep they must finally have a fair chance to develop their great resources and to preserve their people and their culture sep the rainbow coalition includes asian americans, now being killed in our streets -- scapegoats for the failures of corporate, industrial, and economic policies sep the rainbow is making room for the young americans sep twenty years ago, our young people were dying in a war for which they could not even vote sep twenty years later, young america has the power to stop a war in central america and the responsibility to vote in great numbers sep young america must be politically active in 1984 sep the choice is war or peace sep we must make room for young america sep the rainbow includes disabled veterans sep the color scheme fits in the rainbow sep the disabled have their handicap revealed and their genius concealed; while the able-bodied have their genius revealed and their disability concealed sep but ultimately, we must judge people by their values and their contribution sep don't leave anybody out sep i would rather have roosevelt in a wheelchair than reagan on a horse sep the rainbow is making room for small farmers sep they have suffered tremendously under the reagan regime sep they will either receive 90 percent parity or 100 percent charity sep we must address their concerns and make room for them sep the rainbow includes lesbians and gays sep no american citizen ought be denied equal protection from the law sep we must be unusually committed and caring as we expand our family to include new members sep all of us must be tolerant and understanding as the fears and anxieties of the rejected and the party leadership express themselves in many different ways sep too often what we call hate -- as if it were some deeply-rooted philosophy or strategy -- is simply ignorance, anxiety, paranoia, fear, and insecurity sep to be strong leaders, we must be long-suffering as we seek to right the wrongs of our party and our nation sep we must expand our party, heal our party, and unify our party sep that is our mission in 1984 sep we are often reminded that we live in a great nation -- and we do sep but it can be greater still sep the rainbow is mandating a new definition of greatness sep we must not measure greatness from the mansion down, but the manger up sep jesus said that we should not be judged by the bark we wear but by the fruit that we bear sep jesus said that we must measure greatness by how we treat the least of these sep president reagan says the nation is in recovery sep those 90,000 corporations that made a profit last year but paid no federal taxes are recovering sep the 37,000 military contractors who have benefited from reagan's more than doubling of the military budget in peacetime, surely they are recovering sep the big corporations and rich individuals who received the bulk of a three-year, multibillion tax cut from mr sep reagan are recovering sep but no such recovery is under way for the least of these sep rising tides don't lift all boats, particularly those stuck at the bottom sep for the boats stuck at the bottom there's a misery index sep this administration has made life more miserable for the poor sep its attitude has been contemptuous sep its policies and programs have been cruel and unfair to working people sep they must be held accountable in november for increasing infant mortality among the poor sep in detroit one of the great cities of the western world, babies are dying at the same rate as honduras, the most underdeveloped nation in our hemisphere sep this administration must be held accountable for policies that have contributed to the growing poverty in america sep there are now 34 million people in poverty, 15 percent of our nation sep 23 million are white; 11 million black, hispanic, asian, and others -- mostly women and children sep by the end of this year, there will be 41 million people in poverty sep we cannot stand idly by sep we must fight for a change now sep under this regime we look at social security sep the '81 budget cuts included nine permanent social security benefit cuts totaling 20 billion over five years sep small businesses have suffered under reagan tax cuts sep only 18 percent of total business tax cuts went to them; 82 percent to big businesses sep health care under mr sep reagan has already been sharply cut sep education under mr sep reagan has been cut 25 percent sep under mr sep reagan there are now 9 sep 7 million female head families sep they represent 16 percent of all families sep half of all of them are poor sep 70 percent of all poor children live in a house headed by a woman, where there is no man sep under mr sep reagan, the administration has cleaned up only 6 of 546 priority toxic waste dumps sep farmers' real net income was only about half its level in 1979 sep many say that the race in november will be decided in the south sep president reagan is depending on the conservative south to return him to office sep but the south, i tell you, is unnaturally conservative sep the south is the poorest region in our nation and, therefore, [has] the least to conserve sep in his appeal to the south, mr sep reagan is trying to substitute flags and prayer cloths for food, and clothing, and education, health care, and housing sep mr sep reagan will ask us to pray, and i believe in prayer sep i have come to this way by the power of prayer sep but then, we must watch false prophecy sep he cuts energy assistance to the poor, cuts breakfast programs from children, cuts lunch programs from children, cuts job training from children, and then says to an empty table, "let us pray sep " apparently, he is not familiar with the structure of a prayer sep you thank the lord for the food that you are about to receive, not the food that just left sep i think that we should pray, but don't pray for the food that left sep pray for the man that took the food to leave sep we need a change sep we need a change in november sep under mr sep reagan, the misery index has risen for the poor sep the danger index has risen for everybody sep under this administration, we've lost the lives of our boys in central america and honduras, in grenada, in lebanon, in nuclear standoff in europe sep under this administration, one-third of our children believe they will die in a nuclear war sep the danger index is increasing in this world sep all the talk about the defense against russia; the russian submarines are closer, and their missiles are more accurate sep we live in a world tonight more miserable and a world more dangerous sep while reaganomics and reaganism is talked about often, so often we miss the real meaning sep reaganism is a spirit, and reaganomics represents the real economic facts of life sep in 1980, mr sep george bush, a man with reasonable access to mr sep reagan, did an analysis of mr sep reagan's economic plan sep mr sep george bush concluded that reagan's plan was ''voodoo economics sep '' he was right sep third-party candidate john anderson said "a combination of military spending, tax cuts, and a balanced budget by '84 would be accomplished with blue smoke and mirrors sep " they were both right sep mr sep reagan talks about a dynamic recovery sep there's some measure of recovery sep three and a half years later, unemployment has inched just below where it was when he took office in 1981 sep there are still 8 sep 1 million people officially unemployed; 11 million working only part-time sep inflation has come down, but let's analyze for a moment who has paid the price for this superficial economic recovery sep mr sep reagan curbed inflation by cutting consumer demand sep he cut consumer demand with conscious and callous fiscal and monetary policies sep he used the federal budget to deliberately induce unemployment and curb social spending sep he then weighed and supported tight monetary policies of the federal reserve board to deliberately drive up interest rates, again to curb consumer demand created through borrowing sep unemployment reached 10 sep 7 percent sep we experienced skyrocketing interest rates sep our dollar inflated abroad sep there were record bank failures, record farm foreclosures, record business bankruptcies; record budget deficits, record trade deficits sep mr sep reagan brought inflation down by destabilizing our economy and disrupting family life sep he promised -- he promised in 1980 a balanced budget sep but instead we now have a record 200 billion dollar budget deficit sep under mr sep reagan, the cumulative budget deficit for his four years is more than the sum total of deficits from george washington to jimmy carter combined sep i tell you, we need a change sep how is he paying for these short-term jobs sep reagan's economic recovery is being financed by deficit spending -- 200 billion dollars a year sep military spending, a major cause of this deficit, is projected over the next five years to be nearly 2 trillion dollars, and will cost about 40,000 dollars for every taxpaying family sep when the government borrows 200 billion dollars annually to finance the deficit, this encourages the private sector to make its money off of interest rates as opposed to development and economic growth sep even money abroad, we don't have enough money domestically to finance the debt, so we are now borrowing money abroad, from foreign banks, governments and financial institutions: 40 billion dollars in 1983; 70-80 billion dollars in 1984 -- 40 percent of our total; over 100 billion dollars -- 50 percent of our total -- in 1985 sep by 1989, it is projected that 50 percent of all individual income taxes will be going just to pay for interest on that debt sep the united states used to be the largest exporter of capital, but under mr sep reagan we will quite likely become the largest debtor nation sep about two weeks ago, on july the 4th, we celebrated our declaration of independence, yet every day supply-side economics is making our nation more economically dependent and less economically free sep five to six percent of our gross national product is now being eaten up with president reagan's budget deficits sep to depend on foreign military powers to protect our national security would be foolish, making us dependent and less secure sep yet, reaganomics has us increasingly dependent on foreign economic sources sep this consumer-led but deficit-financed recovery is unbalanced and artificial sep we have a challenge as democrats to point a way out sep democracy guarantees opportunity, not success sep democracy guarantees the right to participate, not a license for either a majority or a minority to dominate sep the victory for the rainbow coalition in the platform debates today was not whether we won or lost, but that we raised the right issues sep we could afford to lose the vote; issues are non-negotiable sep we could not afford to avoid raising the right questions sep our self-respect and our moral integrity were at stake sep our heads are perhaps bloody, but not bowed sep our back is straight sep we can go home and face our people sep our vision is clear sep when we think, on this journey from slave-ship to championship, that we have gone from the planks of the boardwalk in atlantic city in 1964 to fighting to help write the planks in the platform in san francisco in '84, there is a deep and abiding sense of joy in our souls in spite of the tears in our eyes sep though there are missing planks, there is a solid foundation upon which to build sep our party can win, but we must provide hope which will inspire people to struggle and achieve; provide a plan that shows a way out of our dilemma and then lead the way sep in 1984, my heart is made to feel glad because i know there is a way out -- justice sep the requirement for rebuilding america is justice sep the linchpin of progressive politics in our nation will not come from the north; they, in fact, will come from the south sep that is why i argue over and over again sep we look from virginia around to texas, there's only one black congressperson out of 115 sep nineteen years later, we're locked out of the congress, the senate and the governor's mansion sep what does this large black vote mean sep why do i fight to win second primaries and fight gerrymandering and annexation and at-large [elections] sep why do we fight over that sep because i tell you, you cannot hold someone in the ditch unless you linger there with them sep unless you linger there sep if you want a change in this nation, you enforce that voting rights act sep we'll get 12 to 20 black, hispanics, female and progressive congresspersons from the south sep we can save the cotton, but we've got to fight the boll weevils sep we've got to make a judgment sep we've got to make a judgment sep it is not enough to hope era will pass sep how can we pass era sep if blacks vote in great numbers, progressive whites win sep it's the only way progressive whites win sep if blacks vote in great numbers, hispanics win sep when blacks, hispanics, and progressive whites vote, women win sep when women win, children win sep when women and children win, workers win sep we must all come up together sep we must come up together sep thank you sep for all of our joy and excitement, we must not save the world and lose our souls sep we should never short-circuit enforcing the voting rights act at every level sep when one of us rise[s], all of us will rise sep justice is the way out sep peace is the way out sep we should not act as if nuclear weaponry is negotiable and debatable sep in this world in which we live, we dropped the bomb on japan and felt guilty, but in 1984 other folks [have] also got bombs sep this time, if we drop the bomb, six minutes later we, too, will be destroyed sep it's not about dropping the bomb on somebody sep it is about dropping the bomb on everybody sep we must choose to develop minds over guided missiles, and think it out and not fight it out sep it's time for a change sep our foreign policy must be characterized by mutual respect, not by gunboat diplomacy, big stick diplomacy, and threats sep our nation at its best feeds the hungry sep our nation at its worst, at its worst, will mine the harbors of nicaragua, at its worst will try to overthrow their government, at its worst will cut aid to american education and increase the aid to el salvador; at its worst, our nation will have partnerships with south africa sep that's a moral disgrace sep it's a moral disgrace sep it's a moral disgrace sep we look at africa sep we cannot just focus on apartheid in southern africa sep we must fight for trade with africa, and not just aid to africa sep we cannot stand idly by and say we will not relate to nicaragua unless they have elections there, and then embrace military regimes in africa overthrowing democratic governments in nigeria and liberia and ghana sep we must fight for democracy all around the world and play the game by one set of rules sep peace in this world sep our present formula for peace in the middle east is inadequate sep it will not work sep there are 22 nations in the middle east sep our nation must be able to talk and act and influence all of them sep we must build upon camp david, and measure human rights by one yard stick sep in that region we have too many interests and too few friends sep there is a way out -- jobs sep put america back to work sep when i was a child growing up in greenville, south carolina, the reverend sample used to preach every so often a sermon relating to jesus sep and he said, "if i be lifted up, i'll draw all men unto me sep " i didn't quite understand what he meant as a child growing up, but i understand a little better now sep if you raise up truth, it's magnetic sep it has a way of drawing people sep with all this confusion in this convention, the bright lights and parties and big fun, we must raise up the simple proposition: if we lift up a program to feed the hungry, they'll come running; if we lift up a program to study war no more, our youth will come running; if we lift up a program to put america back to work, and an alternative to welfare and despair, they will come working sep if we cut that military budget without cutting our defense, and use that money to rebuild bridges and put steel workers back to work, and use that money and provide jobs for our cities, and use that money to build schools and pay teachers and educate our children and build hospitals and train doctors and train nurses, the whole nation will come running to us sep as i leave you now, we vote in this convention and get ready to go back across this nation in a couple of days sep in this campaign, i've tried to be faithful to my promise sep i lived in old barrios, ghettos, and reservations and housing projects sep i have a message for our youth sep i challenge them to put hope in their brains and not dope in their veins sep i told them that like jesus, i, too, was born in the slum sep but just because you're born in the slum does not mean the slum is born in you, and you can rise above it if your mind is made up sep i told them in every slum there are two sides sep when i see a broken window -- that's the slummy side sep train some youth to become a glazier -- that's the sunny side sep when i see a missing brick -- that's the slummy side sep let that child in the union and become a brick mason and build -- that's the sunny side sep when i see a missing door -- that's the slummy side sep train some youth to become a carpenter -- that's the sunny side sep and when i see the vulgar words and hieroglyphics of destitution on the walls -- that's the slummy side sep train some youth to become a painter, an artist -- that's the sunny side sep we leave this place looking for the sunny side because there's a brighter side somewhere sep i'm more convinced than ever that we can win sep we will vault up the rough side of the mountain sep we can win sep i just want young america to do me one favor, just one favor sep exercise the right to dream sep you must face reality -- that which is sep but then dream of a reality that ought to be -- that must be sep live beyond the pain of reality with the dream of a bright tomorrow sep use hope and imagination as weapons of survival and progress sep use love to motivate you and obligate you to serve the human family sep young america, dream sep choose the human race over the nuclear race sep bury the weapons and don't burn the people sep dream -- dream of a new value system sep teachers who teach for life and not just for a living;

ESTP	mr sep president, mr sep speaker, and distinguished members of the congress: i stand on this rostrum with a sense of deep humility and great pride -- humility in the wake of those great american architects of our history who have stood here before me; pride in the reflection that this forum of legislative debate represents human liberty in the purest form yet devised sep here are centered the hopes and aspirations and faith of the entire human race sep i do not stand here as advocate for any partisan cause, for the issues are fundamental and reach quite beyond the realm of partisan consideration sep they must be resolved on the highest plane of national interest if our course is to prove sound and our future protected sep i trust, therefore, that you will do me the justice of receiving that which i have to say as solely expressing the considered viewpoint of a fellow american sep i address you with neither rancor nor bitterness in the fading twilight of life, with but one purpose in mind: to serve my country sep the issues are global and so interlocked that to consider the problems of one sector, oblivious to those of another, is but to court disaster for the whole sep while asia is commonly referred to as the gateway to europe, it is no less true that europe is the gateway to asia, and the broad influence of the one cannot fail to have its impact upon the other sep there are those who claim our strength is inadequate to protect on both fronts, that we cannot divide our effort sep i can think of no greater expression of defeatism sep if a potential enemy can divide his strength on two fronts, it is for us to counter his effort sep the communist threat is a global one sep its successful advance in one sector threatens the destruction of every other sector sep you can not appease or otherwise surrender to communism in asia without simultaneously undermining our efforts to halt its advance in europe sep beyond pointing out these general truisms, i shall confine my discussion to the general areas of asia sep before one may objectively assess the situation now existing there, he must comprehend something of asia's past and the revolutionary changes which are -- which have marked her course up to the present sep long exploited by the so-called colonial powers, with little opportunity to achieve any degree of social justice, individual dignity, or a higher standard of life such as guided our own noble administration in the philippines, the peoples of asia found their opportunity in the war just past to throw off the shackles of colonialism and now see the dawn of new opportunity, a heretofore unfelt dignity, and the self-respect of political freedom sep mustering half of the earth's population, and 60 percent of its natural resources these peoples are rapidly consolidating a new force, both moral and material, with which to raise the living standard and erect adaptations of the design of modern progress to their own distinct cultural environments sep whether one adheres to the concept of colonization or not, this is the direction of asian progress and it may not be stopped sep it is a corollary to the shift of the world economic frontiers as the whole epicenter of world affairs rotates back toward the area whence it started sep in this situation, it becomes vital that our own country orient its policies in consonance with this basic evolutionary condition rather than pursue a course blind to the reality that the colonial era is now past and the asian peoples covet the right to shape their own free destiny sep what they seek now is friendly guidance, understanding, and support -- not imperious direction -- the dignity of equality and not the shame of subjugation sep their pre-war standard of life, pitifully low, is infinitely lower now in the devastation left in war's wake sep world ideologies play little part in asian thinking and are little understood sep what the peoples strive for is the opportunity for a little more food in their stomachs, a little better clothing on their backs, a little firmer roof over their heads, and the realization of the normal nationalist urge for political freedom sep these political-social conditions have but an indirect bearing upon our own national security, but do form a backdrop to contemporary planning which must be thoughtfully considered if we are to avoid the pitfalls of unrealism sep of more direct and immediate bearing upon our national security are the changes wrought in the strategic potential of the pacific ocean in the course of the past war sep prior thereto the western strategic frontier of the united states lay on the littoral line of the americas, with an exposed island salient extending out through hawaii, midway, and guam to the philippines sep that salient proved not an outpost of strength but an avenue of weakness along which the enemy could and did attack sep the pacific was a potential area of advance for any predatory force intent upon striking at the bordering land areas sep all this was changed by our pacific victory sep our strategic frontier then shifted to embrace the entire pacific ocean, which became a vast moat to protect us as long as we held it sep indeed, it acts as a protective shield for all of the americas and all free lands of the pacific ocean area sep we control it to the shores of asia by a chain of islands extending in an arc from the aleutians to the mariannas held by us and our free allies sep from this island chain we can dominate with sea and air power every asiatic port from vladivostok to singapore -- with sea and air power every port, as i said, from vladivostok to singapore -- and prevent any hostile movement into the pacific sep *any predatory attack from asia must be an amphibious effort sep * no amphibious force can be successful without control of the sea lanes and the air over those lanes in its avenue of advance sep with naval and air supremacy and modest ground elements to defend bases, any major attack from continental asia toward us or our friends in the pacific would be doomed to failure sep under such conditions, the pacific no longer represents menacing avenues of approach for a prospective invader sep it assumes, instead, the friendly aspect of a peaceful lake sep our line of defense is a natural one and can be maintained with a minimum of military effort and expense sep it envisions no attack against anyone, nor does it provide the bastions essential for offensive operations, but properly maintained, would be an invincible defense against aggression sep the holding of this littoral defense line in the western pacific is entirely dependent upon holding all segments thereof; for any major breach of that line by an unfriendly power would render vulnerable to determined attack every other major segment sep this is a military estimate as to which i have yet to find a military leader who will take exception sep for that reason, i have strongly recommended in the past, as a matter of military urgency, that under no circumstances must formosa fall under communist control sep such an eventuality would at once threaten the freedom of the philippines and the loss of japan and might well force our western frontier back to the coast of california, oregon and washington sep to understand the changes which now appear upon the chinese mainland, one must understand the changes in chinese character and culture over the past 50 years sep china, up to 50 years ago, was completely non-homogenous, being compartmented into groups divided against each other sep the war-making tendency was almost non-existent, as they still followed the tenets of the confucian ideal of pacifist culture sep at the turn of the century, under the regime of chang tso lin, efforts toward greater homogeneity produced the start of a nationalist urge sep this was further and more successfully developed under the leadership of chiang kai-shek, but has been brought to its greatest fruition under the present regime to the point that it has now taken on the character of a united nationalism of increasingly dominant, aggressive tendencies sep through these past 50 years the chinese people have thus become militarized in their concepts and in their ideals sep they now constitute excellent soldiers, with competent staffs and commanders sep this has produced a new and dominant power in asia, which, for its own purposes, is allied with soviet russia but which in its own concepts and methods has become aggressively imperialistic, with a lust for expansion and increased power normal to this type of imperialism sep there is little of the ideological concept either one way or another in the chinese make-up sep the standard of living is so low and the capital accumulation has been so thoroughly dissipated by war that the masses are desperate and eager to follow any leadership which seems to promise the alleviation of local stringencies sep i have from the beginning believed that the chinese communists' support of the north koreans was the dominant one sep their interests are, at present, parallel with those of the soviet sep but i believe that the aggressiveness recently displayed not only in korea but also in indo-china and tibet and pointing potentially toward the south reflects predominantly the same lust for the expansion of power which has animated every would-be conqueror since the beginning of time sep the japanese people, since the war, have undergone the greatest reformation recorded in modern history sep with a commendable will, eagerness to learn, and marked capacity to understand, they have, from the ashes left in war's wake, erected in japan an edifice dedicated to the supremacy of individual liberty and personal dignity; and in the ensuing process there has been created a truly representative government committed to the advance of political morality, freedom of economic enterprise, and social justice sep politically, economically, and socially japan is now abreast of many free nations of the earth and will not again fail the universal trust sep that it may be counted upon to wield a profoundly beneficial influence over the course of events in asia is attested by the magnificent manner in which the japanese people have met the recent challenge of war, unrest, and confusion surrounding them from the outside and checked communism within their own frontiers without the slightest slackening in their forward progress sep i sent all four of our occupation divisions to the korean battlefront without the slightest qualms as to the effect of the resulting power vacuum upon japan sep the results fully justified my faith sep i know of no nation more serene, orderly, and industrious, nor in which higher hopes can be entertained for future constructive service in the advance of the human race sep of our former ward, the philippines, we can look forward in confidence that the existing unrest will be corrected and a strong and healthy nation will grow in the longer aftermath of war's terrible destructiveness sep we must be patient and understanding and never fail them -- as in our hour of need, they did not fail us sep a christian nation, the philippines stand as a mighty bulwark of christianity in the far east, and its capacity for high moral leadership in asia is unlimited sep on formosa, the government of the republic of china has had the opportunity to refute by action much of the malicious gossip which so undermined the strength of its leadership on the chinese mainland sep the formosan people are receiving a just and enlightened administration with majority representation on the organs of government, and politically, economically, and socially they appear to be advancing along sound and constructive lines sep with this brief insight into the surrounding areas, i now turn to the korean conflict sep while i was not consulted prior to the president's decision to intervene in support of the republic of korea, that decision from a military standpoint, proved a sound one, as we -- as i said, proved a sound one, as we hurled back the invader and decimated his forces sep our victory was complete, and our objectives within reach, when red china intervened with numerically superior ground forces sep this created a new war and an entirely new situation, a situation not contemplated when our forces were committed against the north korean invaders; a situation which called for new decisions in the diplomatic sphere to permit the realistic adjustment of military strategy sep such decisions have not been forthcoming sep while no man in his right mind would advocate sending our ground forces into continental china, and such was never given a thought, the new situation did urgently demand a drastic revision of strategic planning if our political aim was to defeat this new enemy as we had defeated the old sep apart from the military need, as i saw it, to neutralize the sanctuary protection given the enemy north of the yalu, i felt that military necessity in the conduct of the war made necessary: first the intensification of our economic blockade against china; two the imposition of a naval blockade against the china coast; three removal of restrictions on air reconnaissance of china's coastal areas and of manchuria; four removal of restrictions on the forces of the republic of china on formosa, with logistical support to contribute to their effective operations against the common enemy sep for entertaining these views, all professionally designed to support our forces committed to korea and bring hostilities to an end with the least possible delay and at a saving of countless american and allied lives, i have been severely criticized in lay circles, principally abroad, despite my understanding that from a military standpoint the above views have been fully shared in the past by practically every military leader concerned with the korean campaign, including our own joint chiefs of staff sep i called for reinforcements but was informed that reinforcements were not available sep i made clear that if not permitted to destroy the enemy built-up bases north of the yalu, if not permitted to utilize the friendly chinese force of some 600,000 men on formosa, if not permitted to blockade the china coast to prevent the chinese reds from getting succor from without, and if there were to be no hope of major reinforcements, the position of the command from the military standpoint forbade victory sep we could hold in korea by constant maneuver and in an approximate area where our supply line advantages were in balance with the supply line disadvantages of the enemy, but we could hope at best for only an indecisive campaign with its terrible and constant attrition upon our forces if the enemy utilized its full military potential sep i have constantly called for the new political decisions essential to a solution sep efforts have been made to distort my position sep it has been said, in effect, that i was a warmonger sep nothing could be further from the truth sep i know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is more revolting sep i have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a means of settling international disputes sep indeed, on the second day of september, nineteen hundred and forty-five, just following the surrender of the japanese nation on the battleship missouri, i formally cautioned as follows: men since the beginning of time have sought peace sep various methods through the ages have been attempted to devise an international process to prevent or settle disputes between nations sep from the very start workable methods were found in so far as individual citizens were concerned, but the mechanics of an instrumentality of larger international scope have never been successful sep military alliances, balances of power, leagues of nations, all in turn failed, leaving the only path to be by way of the crucible of war sep the utter destructiveness of war now blocks out this alternative sep we have had our last chance sep if we will not devise some greater and more equitable system, armageddon will be at our door sep the problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronize with our almost matchless advances in science, art, literature, and all material and cultural developments of the past 2000 years sep it must be of the spirit if we are to save the flesh sep but once war is forced upon us, there is no other alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end sep war's very object is victory, not prolonged indecision sep in war there is no substitute for victory sep there are some who, for varying reasons, would appease red china sep they are blind to history's clear lesson, for history teaches with unmistakable emphasis that appeasement but begets new and bloodier war sep it points to no single instance where this end has justified that means, where appeasement has led to more than a sham peace sep like blackmail, it lays the basis for new and successively greater demands until, as in blackmail, violence becomes the only other alternative sep "why," my soldiers asked of me, "surrender military advantages to an enemy in the field sep " i could not answer sep some may say: to avoid spread of the conflict into an all-out war with china; others, to avoid soviet intervention sep neither explanation seems valid, for china is already engaging with the maximum power it can commit, and the soviet will not necessarily mesh its actions with our moves sep like a cobra, any new enemy will more likely strike whenever it feels that the relativity in military or other potential is in its favor on a world-wide basis sep the tragedy of korea is further heightened by the fact that its military action is confined to its territorial limits sep it condemns that nation, which it is our purpose to save, to suffer the devastating impact of full naval and air bombardment while the enemy's sanctuaries are fully protected from such attack and devastation sep of the nations of the world, korea alone, up to now, is the sole one which has risked its all against communism sep the magnificence of the courage and fortitude of the korean people defies description sep they have chosen to risk death rather than slavery sep their last words to me were: "don't scuttle the pacific sep "i have just left your fighting sons in korea sep they have met all tests there, and i can report to you without reservation that they are splendid in every way sep it was my constant effort to preserve them and end this savage conflict honorably and with the least loss of time and a minimum sacrifice of life sep its growing bloodshed has caused me the deepest anguish and anxiety sep those gallant men will remain often in my thoughts and in my prayers always sep i am closing my 52 years of military service sep when i joined the army, even before the turn of the century, it was the fulfillment of all of my boyish hopes and dreams sep the world has turned over many times since i took the oath on the plain at west point, and the hopes and dreams have long since vanished, but i still remember the refrain of one of the most popular barrack ballads of that day which proclaimed most proudly that "old soldiers never die; they just fade away sep "and like the old soldier of that ballad, i now close my military career and just fade away, an old soldier who tried to do his duty as god gave him the light to see that duty sep good bye
ENFJ	thank you very kindly, my friends sep as i listened to ralph abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself, i wondered who he was talking about sep it's always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you sep and ralph abernathy is the best friend that i have in the world sep i'm delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of a storm warning sep you reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow sep something is happening in memphis; something is happening in our world sep and you know, if i were standing at the beginning of time, with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now, and the almighty said to me, "martin luther king, which age would you like to live in sep " i would take my mental flight by egypt and i would watch god's children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of egypt through, or rather across the red sea, through the wilderness on toward the promised land sep and in spite of its magnificence, i wouldn't stop there sep i would move on by greece and take my mind to mount olympus sep and i would see plato, aristotle, socrates, euripides and aristophanes assembled around the parthenon sep and i would watch them around the parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality sep but i wouldn't stop there sep i would go on, even to the great heyday of the roman empire sep and i would see developments around there, through various emperors and leaders sep but i wouldn't stop there sep i would even come up to the day of the renaissance, and get a quick picture of all that the renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man sep but i wouldn't stop there sep i would even go by the way that the man for whom i am named had his habitat sep and i would watch martin luther as he tacked his ninety-five theses on the door at the church of wittenberg sep but i wouldn't stop there sep i would come on up even to 1863, and watch a vacillating president by the name of abraham lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the emancipation proclamation sep but i wouldn't stop there sep i would even come up to the early thirties, and see a man grappling with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation sep and come with an eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but "fear itself sep " but i wouldn't stop there sep strangely enough, i would turn to the almighty, and say, "if you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the 20th century, i will be happy sep "now that's a strange statement to make, because the world is all messed up sep the nation is sick sep trouble is in the land; confusion all around sep that's a strange statement sep but i know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars sep and i see god working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men, in some strange way, are responding sep something is happening in our world sep the masses of people are rising up sep and wherever they are assembled today, whether they are in johannesburg, south africa; nairobi, kenya; accra, ghana; new york city; atlanta, georgia; jackson, mississippi; or memphis, tennessee -- the cry is always the same: "we want to be free sep "and another reason that i'm happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where we are going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history, but the demands didn't force them to do it sep survival demands that we grapple with them sep men, for years now, have been talking about war and peace sep but now, no longer can they just talk about it sep it is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world; it's nonviolence or nonexistence sep that is where we are today sep and also in the human rights revolution, if something isn't done, and done in a hurry, to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty, their long years of hurt and neglect, the whole world is doomed sep now, i'm just happy that god has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding sep and i'm happy that he's allowed me to be in memphis sep i can remember -- i can remember when negroes were just going around as ralph has said, so often, scratching where they didn't itch, and laughing when they were not tickled sep but that day is all over sep we mean business now, and we are determined to gain our rightful place in god's world sep and that's all this whole thing is about sep we aren't engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody sep we are saying that we are determined to be men sep we are determined to be people sep we are saying -- we are saying that we are god's children sep and that we are god's children, we don't have to live like we are forced to live sep now, what does all of this mean in this great period of history sep it means that we've got to stay together sep we've got to stay together and maintain unity sep you know, whenever pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in egypt, he had a favorite, favorite formula for doing it sep what was that sep he kept the slaves fighting among themselves sep but whenever the slaves get together, something happens in pharaoh's court, and he cannot hold the slaves in slavery sep when the slaves get together, that's the beginning of getting out of slavery sep now let us maintain unity sep secondly, let us keep the issues where they are sep the issue is injustice sep the issue is the refusal of memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants, who happen to be sanitation workers sep now, we've got to keep attention on that sep that's always the problem with a little violence sep you know what happened the other day, and the press dealt only with the window-breaking sep i read the articles sep they very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand, three hundred sanitation workers are on strike, and that memphis is not being fair to them, and that mayor loeb is in dire need of a doctor sep they didn't get around to that sep now we're going to march again, and we've got to march again, in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be -- and force everybody to see that there are thirteen hundred of god's children here suffering, sometimes going hungry, going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out sep that's the issue sep and we've got to say to the nation: we know how it's coming out sep for when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of victory sep we aren't going to let any mace stop us sep we are masters in our nonviolent movement in disarming police forces; they don't know what to do sep i've seen them so often sep i remember in birmingham, alabama, when we were in that majestic struggle there, we would move out of the 16th street baptist church day after day; by the hundreds we would move out sep and bull connor would tell them to send the dogs forth, and they did come; but we just went before the dogs singing, "ain't gonna let nobody turn me around sep "bull connor next would say, "turn the fire hoses on sep " and as i said to you the other night, bull connor didn't know history sep he knew a kind of physics that somehow didn't relate to the transphysics that we knew about sep and that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out sep and we went before the fire hoses; we had known water sep if we were baptist or some other denominations, we had been immersed sep if we were methodist, and some others, we had been sprinkled, but we knew water sep that couldn't stop us sep and we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them; and we'd go on before the water hoses and we would look at it, and we'd just go on singing "over my head i see freedom in the air sep " and then we would be thrown in the paddy wagons, and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can sep and they would throw us in, and old bull would say, "take 'em off," and they did; and we would just go in the paddy wagon singing, "we shall overcome sep " and every now and then we'd get in jail, and we'd see the jailers looking through the windows being moved by our prayers, and being moved by our words and our songs sep and there was a power there which bull connor couldn't adjust to; and so we ended up transforming bull into a steer, and we won our struggle in birmingham sep now we've got to go on in memphis just like that sep i call upon you to be with us when we go out monday sep now about injunctions: we have an injunction and we're going into court tomorrow morning to fight this illegal, unconstitutional injunction sep all we say to america is, "be true to what you said on paper sep " if i lived in china or even russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe i could understand some of these illegal injunctions sep maybe i could understand the denial of certain basic first amendment privileges, because they hadn't committed themselves to that over there sep but somewhere i read of the freedom of assembly sep somewhere i read of the freedom of speech sep somewhere i read of the freedom of press sep somewhere i read that the greatness of america is the right to protest for right sep and so just as i say, we aren't going to let dogs or water hoses turn us around, we aren't going to let any injunction turn us around sep we are going on sep we need all of you sep and you know what's beautiful to me is to see all of these ministers of the gospel sep it's a marvelous picture sep who is it that is supposed to articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher sep somehow the preacher must have a kind of fire shut up in his bones sep and whenever injustice is around he tell it sep somehow the preacher must be an amos, and saith, "when god speaks who can but prophesy sep " again with amos, "let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream sep " somehow the preacher must say with jesus, "the spirit of the lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me," and he's anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor sep "and i want to commend the preachers, under the leadership of these noble men: james lawson, one who has been in this struggle for many years; he's been to jail for struggling; he's been kicked out of vanderbilt university for this struggle, but he's still going on, fighting for the rights of his people sep reverend ralph jackson, billy kiles; i could just go right on down the list, but time will not permit sep but i want to thank all of them sep and i want you to thank them, because so often, preachers aren't concerned about anything but themselves sep and i'm always happy to see a relevant ministry sep it's all right to talk about "long white robes over yonder," in all of its symbolism sep but ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here sep it's all right to talk about "streets flowing with milk and honey," but god has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here, and his children who can't eat three square meals a day sep it's all right to talk about the new jerusalem, but one day, god's preacher must talk about the new new york, the new atlanta, the new philadelphia, the new los angeles, the new memphis, tennessee sep this is what we have to do sep now the other thing we'll have to do is this: always anchor our external direct action with the power of economic withdrawal sep now, we are poor people sep individually, we are poor when you compare us with white society in america sep we are poor sep never stop and forget that collectively -- that means all of us together -- collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world, with the exception of nine sep did you ever think about that sep after you leave the united states, soviet russia, great britain, west germany, france, and i could name the others, the american negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world sep we have an annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year, which is more than all of the exports of the united states, and more than the national budget of canada sep did you know that sep that's power right there, if we know how to pool it sep we don't have to argue with anybody sep we don't have to curse and go around acting bad with our words sep we don't need any bricks and bottles sep we don't need any molotov cocktails sep we just need to go around to these stores, and to these massive industries in our country, and say,"god sent us by here, to say to you that you're not treating his children right sep and we've come by here to ask you to make the first item on your agenda fair treatment, where god's children are concerned sep now, if you are not prepared to do that, we do have an agenda that we must follow sep and our agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you sep "and so, as a result of this, we are asking you tonight, to go out and tell your neighbors not to buy coca-cola in memphis sep go by and tell them not to buy sealtest milk sep tell them not to buy -- what is the other bread sep -- wonder bread sep and what is the other bread company, jesse sep tell them not to buy hart's bread sep as jesse jackson has said, up to now, only the garbage men have been feeling pain; now we must kind of redistribute the pain sep we are choosing these companies because they haven't been fair in their hiring policies; and we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike sep and then they can move on town -- downtown and tell mayor loeb to do what is right sep but not only that, we've got to strengthen black institutions sep i call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in tri-state bank sep we want a "bank-in" movement in memphis sep go by the savings and loan association sep i'm not asking you something that we don't do ourselves at sclc sep judge hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings and loan association from the southern christian leadership conference sep we are telling you to follow what we are doing sep put your money there sep you have six or seven black insurance companies here in the city of memphis sep take out your insurance there sep we want to have an "insurance-in sep "now these are some practical things that we can do sep we begin the process of building a greater economic base sep and at the same time, we are putting pressure where it really hurts sep i ask you to follow through here sep now, let me say as i move to my conclusion that we've got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end sep nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in memphis sep we've got to see it through sep and when we have our march, you need to be there sep if it means leaving work, if it means leaving school -- be there sep be concerned about your brother sep you may not be on strike sep but either we go up together, or we go down together sep let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness sep one day a man came to jesus, and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters of life sep at points he wanted to trick jesus, and show him that he knew a little more than jesus knew and throw him off base sep sep sep sep now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate sep but jesus immediately pulled that question from mid-air, and placed it on a dangerous curve between jerusalem and jericho sep and he talked about a certain man, who fell among thieves sep you remember that a levite and a priest passed by on the other side sep they didn't stop to help him sep and finally a man of another race came by sep he got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy sep but he got down with him, administered first aid, and helped the man in need sep jesus ended up saying, this was the good man, this was the great man, because he had the capacity to project the "i" into the "thou," and to be concerned about his brother sep now you know, we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the levite didn't stop sep at times we say they were busy going to a church meeting, an ecclesiastical gathering, and they had to get on down to jerusalem so they wouldn't be late for their meeting sep at other times we would speculate that there was a religious law that "one who was engaged in religious ceremonials was not to touch a human body twenty-four hours before the ceremony sep " and every now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to jerusalem -- or down to jericho, rather to organize a "jericho road improvement association sep " that's a possibility sep maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root, rather than to get bogged down with an individual effect sep but i'm going to tell you what my imagination tells me sep it's possible that those men were afraid sep you see, the jericho road is a dangerous road sep i remember when mrs sep king and i were first in jerusalem sep we rented a car and drove from jerusalem down to jericho sep and as soon as we got on that road, i said to my wife, "i can see why jesus used this as the setting for his parable sep " it's a winding, meandering road sep it's really conducive for ambushing sep you start out in jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level sep and by the time you get down to jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level sep that's a dangerous road sep in the days of jesus it came to be known as the "bloody pass sep " and you know, it's possible that the priest and the levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around sep or it's possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking sep and he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt, in order to seize them over there, lure them there for quick and easy seizure sep and so the first question that the priest asked -- the first question that the levite asked was, "if i stop to help this man, what will happen to me sep " but then the good samaritan came by sep and he reversed the question: "if i do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him sep "that's the question before you tonight sep not, "if i stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to my job sep not, "if i stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that i usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor sep " the question is not, "if i stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me sep " the question is, "if i do not stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to them sep " that's the question sep let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness sep let us stand with a greater determination sep and let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make america what it ought to be sep we have an opportunity to make america a better nation sep and i want to thank god, once more, for allowing me to be here with you sep you know, several years ago, i was in new york city autographing the first book that i had written sep and while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up sep the only question i heard from her was, "are you martin luther king sep " and i was looking down writing, and i said, "yes sep " and the next minute i felt something beating on my chest sep before i knew it i had been stabbed by this demented woman sep i was rushed to harlem hospital sep it was a dark saturday afternoon sep and that blade had gone through, and the x-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery sep and once that's punctured, your drowned in your own blood -- that's the end of you sep it came out in the new york times the next morning, that if i had merely sneezed, i would have died sep well, about four days later, they allowed me, after the operation, after my chest had been opened, and the blade had been taken out, to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital sep they allowed me to read some of the mail that came in, and from all over the states and the world, kind letters came in sep i read a few, but one of them i will never forget sep i had received one from the president and the vice-president sep i've forgotten what those telegrams said sep i'd received a visit and a letter from the governor of new york, but i've forgotten what that letter said sep but there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the white plains high school sep and i looked at that letter, and i'll never forget it sep it said simply,"dear dr sep king,i am a ninth-grade student at the white plains high school sep "and she said,"while it should not matter, i would like to mention that i'm a white girl sep i read in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering sep and i read that if you had sneezed, you would have died sep and i'm simply writing you to say that i'm so happy that you didn't sneeze sep "and i want to say tonight -- i want to say tonight that i too am happy that i didn't sneeze sep because if i had sneezed, i wouldn't have been around here in 1960, when students all over the south started sitting-in at lunch counters sep and i knew that as they were sitting in, they were really standing up for the best in the american dream, and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the founding fathers in the declaration of independence and the constitution sep if i had sneezed, i wouldn't have been around here in 1961, when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in inter-state travel sep if i had sneezed, i wouldn't have been around here in 1962, when negroes in albany, georgia, decided to straighten their backs up sep and whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless it is bent sep if i had sneezed -- if i had sneezed i wouldn't have been here in 1963, when the black people of birmingham, alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation, and brought into being the civil rights bill sep if i had sneezed, i wouldn't have had a chance later that year, in august, to try to tell america about a dream that i had had sep if i had sneezed, i wouldn't have been down in selma, alabama, to see the great movement there sep if i had sneezed, i wouldn't have been in memphis to see a community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering sep i'm so happy that i didn't sneeze sep and they were telling me -- sep now, it doesn't matter, now sep it really doesn't matter what happens now sep i left atlanta this morning, and as we got started on the plane, there were six of us sep the pilot said over the public address system, "we are sorry for the delay, but we have dr sep martin luther king on the plane sep and to be sure that all of the bags were checked, and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on the plane, we had to check out everything carefully sep and we've had the plane protected and guarded all night sep "and then i got into memphis sep and some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out sep what would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers sep well, i don't know what will happen now sep we've got some difficult days ahead sep but it really doesn't matter with me now, because i've been to the mountaintop sep and i don't mind sep like anybody, i would like to live a long life sep longevity has its place sep but i'm not concerned about that now sep i just want to do god's will sep and he's allowed me to go up to the mountain sep and i've looked over sep and i've seen the promised land sep i may not get there with you sep but i want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land sep and so i'm happy, tonight sep i'm not worried about anything sep i'm not fearing any man sep mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord sep
ESTP	over a century ago washington laid the corner stone of the capitol in what was then little more than a tract of wooded wilderness here beside the potomac sep we now find it necessary to provide by great additional buildings for the business of the government sep this growth in the need for the housing of the government is but a proof and example of the way in which the nation has grown and the sphere of action of the national government has grown sep we now administer the affairs of a nation in which the extraordinary growth of population has been outstripped by the growth of wealth in complex interests sep the material problems that face us today are not such as they were in washington's time, but the underlying facts of human nature are the same now as they were then sep under altered external form we war with the same tendencies toward evil that were evident in washington's time, and are helped by the same tendencies for good sep it is about some of these that i wish to say a word today sep in bunyan's "pilgrim's progress" you may recall the description of the man with the muck rake, the man who could look no way but downward, with the muck rake in his hand; who was offered a celestial crown for his muck rake, but who would neither look up nor regard the crown he was offered, but continued to rake to himself the filth of the floor sep in "pilgrim's progress" the man with the muck rake is set forth as the example of him whose vision is fixed on carnal instead of spiritual things sep yet he also typifies the man who in this life consistently refuses to see aught that is lofty, and fixes his eyes with solemn intentness only on that which is vile and debasing sep now, it is very necessary that we should not flinch from seeing what is vile and debasing sep there is filth on the floor, and it must be scraped up with the muck rake; and there are times and places where this service is the most needed of all the services that can be performed sep but the man who never does anything else, who never thinks or speaks or writes, save of his feats with the muck rake, speedily becomes, not a help but one of the most potent forces for evil sep there are in the body politic, economic and social, many and grave evils, and there is urgent necessity for the sternest war upon them sep there should be relentless exposure of and attack upon every evil man, whether politician or business man, every evil practice, whether in politics, business, or social life sep i hail as a benefactor every writer or speaker, every man who, on the platform or in a book, magazine, or newspaper, with merciless severity makes such attack, provided always that he in his turn remembers that the attack is of use only if it is absolutely truthful sep the liar is no whit better than the thief, and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves sep it puts a premium upon knavery untruthfully to attack an honest man, or even with hysterical exaggeration to assail a bad man with untruth sep an epidemic of indiscriminate assault upon character does no good, but very great harm sep the soul of every scoundrel is gladdened whenever an honest man is assailed, or even when a scoundrel is untruthfully assailed sep now, it is easy to twist out of shape what i have just said, easy to affect to misunderstand it, and if it is slurred over in repetition not difficult really to misunderstand it sep some persons are sincerely incapable of understanding that to denounce mud slinging does not mean the endorsement of whitewashing; and both the interested individuals who need whitewashing and those others who practice mud slinging like to encourage such confusion of ideas sep one of the chief counts against those who make indiscriminate assault upon men in business or men in public life is that they invite a reaction which is sure to tell powerfully in favor of the unscrupulous scoundrel who really ought to be attacked, who ought to be exposed, who ought, if possible, to be put in the penitentiary sep if aristides is praised overmuch as just, people get tired of hearing it; and over-censure of the unjust finally and from similar reasons results in their favor sep any excess is almost sure to invite a reaction; and, unfortunately, the reactions instead of taking the form of punishment of those guilty of the excess, is apt to take the form either of punishment of the unoffending or of giving immunity, and even strength, to offenders sep the effort to make financial or political profit out of the destruction of character can only result in public calamity sep gross and reckless assaults on character, whether on the stump or in newspaper, magazine, or book, create a morbid and vicious public sentiment, and at the same time act as a profound deterrent to able men of normal sensitiveness and tend to prevent them from entering the public service at any price sep as an instance in point, i may mention that one serious difficulty encountered in getting the right type of men to dig the panama canal is the certainty that they will be exposed, both without, and, i am sorry to say, sometimes within, congress, to utterly reckless assaults on their character and capacity sep at the risk of repetition let me say again that my plea is not for immunity to, but for the most unsparing exposure of, the politician who betrays his trust, of the big business man who makes or spends his fortune in illegitimate or corrupt ways sep there should be a resolute effort to hunt every such man out of the position he has disgraced sep expose the crime, and hunt down the criminal; but remember that even in the case of crime, if it is attacked in sensational, lurid, and untruthful fashion, the attack may do more damage to the public mind than the crime itself sep it is because i feel that there should be no rest in the endless war against the forces of evil that i ask the war be conducted with sanity as well as with resolution sep the men with the muck rakes are often indispensable to the well being of society; but only if they know when to stop raking the muck, and to look upward to the celestial crown above them, to the crown of worthy endeavor sep there are beautiful things above and round about them; and if they gradually grow to feel that the whole world is nothing but muck, their power of usefulness is gone sep if the whole picture is painted black there remains no hue whereby to single out the rascals for distinction from their fellows sep such painting finally induces a kind of moral color blindness; and people affected by it come to the conclusion that no man is really black, and no man really white, but they are all gray sep in other words, they neither believe in the truth of the attack, nor in the honesty of the man who is attacked; they grow as suspicious of the accusation as of the offense; it becomes well nigh hopeless to stir them either to wrath against wrongdoing or to enthusiasm for what is right; and such a mental attitude in the public gives hope to every knave, and is the despair of honest men sep to assail the great and admitted evils of our political and industrial life with such crude and sweeping generalizations as to include decent men in the general condemnation means the searing of the public conscience sep there results a general attitude either of cynical belief in and indifference to public corruption or else of a distrustful inability to discriminate between the good and the bad sep either attitude is fraught with untold damage to the country as a whole sep the fool who has not sense to discriminate between what is good and what is bad is well nigh as dangerous as the man who does discriminate and yet chooses the bad sep there is nothing more distressing to every good patriot, to every good american, than the hard, scoffing spirit which treats the allegation of dishonesty in a public man as a cause for laughter sep such laughter is worse than the crackling of thorns under a pot, for it denotes not merely the vacant mind, but the heart in which high emotions have been choked before they could grow to fruition sep there is any amount of good in the world, and there never was a time when loftier and more disinterested work for the betterment of mankind was being done than now sep the forces that tend for evil are great and terrible, but the forces of truth and love and courage and honesty and generosity and sympathy are also stronger than ever before sep it is a foolish and timid, no less than a wicked thing, to blink the fact that the forces of evil are strong, but it is even worse to fail to take into account the strength of the forces that tell for good sep hysterical sensationalism is the poorest weapon wherewith to fight for lasting righteousness sep the men who with stern sobriety and truth assail the many evils of our time, whether in the public press, or in magazines, or in books, are the leaders and allies of all engaged in the work for social and political betterment sep but if they give good reason for distrust of what they say, if they chill the ardor of those who demand truth as a primary virtue, they thereby betray the good cause and play into the hands of the very men against whom they are nominally at war sep in his ecclesiastical polity that fine old elizabethan divine, bishop hooker, wrote: he that goeth about to persuade a multitude that they are not so well governed as they ought to be shall never want attentive and favorable hearers, because they know the manifold defects whereunto every kind of regimen is subject, but the secret lets and difficulties, which in public proceedings are innumerable and inevitable, they have not ordinarily the judgment to consider sep this truth should be kept constantly in mind by every free people desiring to preserve the sanity and poise indispensable to the permanent success of self-government sep yet, on the other hand, it is vital not to permit this spirit of sanity and self-command to degenerate into mere mental stagnation sep bad though a state of hysterical excitement is, and evil though the results are which come from the violent oscillations such excitement invariably produces, yet a sodden acquiescence in evil is even worse sep at this moment we are passing through a period of great unrest-social, political, and industrial unrest sep it is of the utmost importance for our future that this should prove to be not the unrest of mere rebelliousness against life, of mere dissatisfaction with the inevitable inequality of conditions, but the unrest of a resolute and eager ambition to secure the betterment of the individual and the nation sep so far as this movement of agitation throughout the country takes the form of a fierce discontent with evil, of a determination to punish the authors of evil, whether in industry or politics, the feeling is to be heartily welcomed as a sign of healthy life sep if, on the other hand, it turns into a mere crusade of appetite against appetite, of a contest between the brutal greed of the "have nots" and the brutal greed of the "haves," then it has no significance for good, but only for evil sep if it seeks to establish a line of cleavage, not along the line which divides good men from bad, but along that other line, running at right angles thereto, which divides those who are well off from those who are less well off, then it will be fraught with immeasurable harm to the body politic sep we can no more and no less afford to condone evil in the man of capital than evil in the man of no capital sep the wealthy man who exults because there is a failure of justice in the effort to bring some trust magnate to account for his misdeeds is as bad as, and no worse than, the so-called labor leader who clamorously strives to excite a foul class feeling on behalf of some other labor leader who is implicated in murder sep one attitude is as bad as the other, and no worse; in each case the accused is entitled to exact justice; and in neither case is there need of action by others which can be construed into an expression of sympathy for crime sep it is a prime necessity that if the present unrest is to result in permanent good the emotion shall be translated into action, and that the action shall be marked by honesty, sanity, and self-restraint sep there is mighty little good in a mere spasm of reform sep the reform that counts is that which comes through steady, continuous growth; violent emotionalism leads to exhaustion sep it is important to this people to grapple with the problems connected with the amassing of enormous fortunes, and the use of those fortunes, both corporate and individual, in business sep we should discriminate in the sharpest way between fortunes well won and fortunes ill won; between those gained as an incident to performing great services to the community as a whole and those gained in evil fashion by keeping just within the limits of mere law honesty sep of course, no amount of charity in spending such fortunes in any way compensates for misconduct in making them sep as a matter of personal conviction, and without pretending to discuss the details or formulate the system, i feel that we shall ultimately have to consider the adoption of some such scheme as that of a progressive tax on all fortunes, beyond a certain amount, either given in life or devised or bequeathed upon death to any individual-a tax so framed as to put it out of the power of the owner of one of these enormous fortunes to hand on more than a certain amount to any one individual; the tax of course, to be imposed by the national and not the state government sep such taxation should, of course, be aimed merely at the inheritance or transmission in their entirety of those fortunes swollen beyond all healthy limits sep again, the national government must in some form exercise supervision over corporations engaged in interstate business-and all large corporations engaged in interstate business-whether by license or otherwise, so as to permit us to deal with the far reaching evils of overcapitalization sep this year we are making a beginning in the direction of serious effort to settle some of these economic problems by the railway rate legislation sep such legislation, if so framed, as i am sure it will be, as to secure definite and tangible results, will amount to something of itself; and it will amount to a great deal more in so far as it is taken as a first step in the direction of a policy of superintendence and control over corporate wealth engaged in interstate commerce; this superintendence and control not to be exercised in a spirit of malevolence toward the men who have created the wealth, but with the firm purpose both to do justice to them and to see that they in their turn do justice to the public at large sep the first requisite in the public servants who are to deal in this shape with corporations, whether as legislators or as executives, is honesty sep this honesty can be no respecter of persons sep there can be no such thing as unilateral honesty sep the danger is not really from corrupt corporations; it springs from the corruption itself, whether exercised for or against corporations sep the eighth commandment reads, "thou shalt not steal sep " it does not read, "thou shalt not steal from the rich man sep " it does not read, "thou shalt not steal from the poor man sep " it reads simply and plainly, "thou shalt not steal sep "no good whatever will come from that warped and mock morality which denounces the misdeeds of men of wealth and forgets the misdeeds practiced at their expense; which denounces bribery, but blinds itself to blackmail; which foams with rage if a corporation secures favors by improper methods, and merely leers with hideous mirth if the corporation is itself wronged sep the only public servant who can be trusted honestly to protect the rights of the public against the misdeeds of a corporation is that public man who will just as surely protect the corporation itself from wrongful aggression sep if a public man is willing to yield to popular clamor and do wrong to the men of wealth or to rich corporations, it may be set down as certain that if the opportunity comes he will secretly and furtively do wrong to the public in the interest of a corporation sep but in addition to honesty, we need sanity sep no honesty will make a public man useful if that man is timid or foolish, if he is a hot-headed zealot or an impracticable visionary sep as we strive for reform we find that it is not at all merely the case of a long uphill pull sep on the contrary, there is almost as much of breeching work as of collar work sep to depend only on traces means that there will soon be a runaway and an upset sep the men of wealth who today are trying to prevent the regulation and control of their business in the interest of the public by the proper government authorities will not succeed, in my judgment, in checking the progress of the movement sep but if they did succeed they would find that they had sown the wind and would surely reap the whirlwind, for they would ultimately provoke the violent excesses which accompany a reform coming by convulsion instead of by steady and natural growth sep on the other hand, the wild preachers of unrest and discontent, the wild agitators against the entire existing order, the men who act crookedly, whether because of sinister design or from mere puzzle headedness, the men who preach destruction without proposing any substitute for what they intend to destroy, or who propose a substitute which would be far worse than the existing evils-all these men are the most dangerous opponents of real reform sep if they get their way they will lead the people into a deeper pit than any into which they could fall under the present system sep if they fail to get their way they will still do incalculable harm by provoking the kind of reaction which in its revolt against the senseless evil of their teaching would enthrone more securely than ever the evils which their misguided followers believe they are attacking sep more important than aught else is the development of the broadest sympathy of man for man sep the welfare of the wage worker, the welfare of the tiller of the soil, upon these depend the welfare of the entire country; their good is not to be sought in pulling down others; but their good must be the prime object of all our statesmanship sep materially we must strive to secure a broader economic opportunity for all men, so that each shall have a better chance to show the stuff of which he is made sep spiritually and ethically we must strive to bring about clean living and right thinking sep we appreciate that the things of the body are important; but we appreciate also that the things of the soul are immeasurably more important sep the foundation stone of national life is, and ever must be, the high individual character of the average citizen
ENFJ	ladies and gentlemen,i'm only going to talk to you just for a minute or so this evening, because i have some -- some very sad news for all of you -- could you lower those signs, please sep -- i have some very sad news for all of you, and, i think, sad news for all of our fellow citizens, and people who love peace all over the world; and that is that martin luther king was shot and was killed tonight in memphis, tennessee sep martin luther king dedicated his life to love and to justice between fellow human beings sep he died in the cause of that effort sep in this difficult day, in this difficult time for the united states, it's perhaps well to ask what kind of a nation we are and what direction we want to move in sep for those of you who are black -- considering the evidence evidently is that there were white people who were responsible -- you can be filled with bitterness, and with hatred, and a desire for revenge sep we can move in that direction as a country, in greater polarization -- black people amongst blacks, and white amongst whites, filled with hatred toward one another sep or we can make an effort, as martin luther king did, to understand, and to comprehend, and replace that violence, that stain of bloodshed that has spread across our land, with an effort to understand, compassion, and love sep for those of you who are black and are tempted to fill with -- be filled with hatred and mistrust of the injustice of such an act, against all white people, i would only say that i can also feel in my own heart the same kind of feeling sep i had a member of my family killed, but he was killed by a white man sep but we have to make an effort in the united states sep we have to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, or go beyond these rather difficult times sep my favorite poem, my -- my favorite poet was aeschylus sep and he once wrote: even in our sleep, pain which cannot forgetfalls drop by drop upon the heart,until, in our own despair,against our will,comes wisdomthrough the awful grace of god sep what we need in the united states is not division; what we need in the united states is not hatred; what we need in the united states is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another; and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black sep so i ask you tonight to return home, to say a prayer for the family of martin luther king -- yeah, it's true -- but more importantly to say a prayer for our own country, which all of us love -- a prayer for understanding and that compassion of which i spoke sep we can do well in this country sep we will have difficult times sep we've had difficult times in the past, but we -- and we will have difficult times in the future sep it is not the end of violence; it is not the end of lawlessness; and it's not the end of disorder sep but the vast majority of white people and the vast majority of black people in this country want to live together, want to improve the quality of our life, and want justice for all human beings that abide in our land sep and let's dedicate ourselves to what the greeks wrote so many years ago: to tame the savageness of man and make gentle the life of this world sep let us dedicate ourselves to that, and say a prayer for our country and for our people sep thank you very much
ISTJ	good evening, my fellow americans sep first, i should like to express my gratitude to the radio and television networks for the opportunities they have given me over the years to bring reports and messages to our nation sep my special thanks go to them for the opportunity of addressing you this evening sep three days from now, after half century in the service of our country, i shall lay down the responsibilities of office as, in traditional and solemn ceremony, the authority of the presidency is vested in my successor sep this evening, i come to you with a message of leave-taking and farewell, and to share a few final thoughts with you, my countrymen sep like every other -- like every other citizen, i wish the new president, and all who will labor with him, godspeed sep i pray that the coming years will be blessed with peace and prosperity for all sep our people expect their president and the congress to find essential agreement on issues of great moment, the wise resolution of which will better shape the future of the nation sep my own relations with the congress, which began on a remote and tenuous basis when, long ago, a member of the senate appointed me to west point, have since ranged to the intimate during the war and immediate post-war period, and finally to the mutually interdependent during these past eight years sep in this final relationship, the congress and the administration have, on most vital issues, cooperated well, to serve the nation good, rather than mere partisanship, and so have assured that the business of the nation should go forward sep so, my official relationship with the congress ends in a feeling -- on my part -- of gratitude that we have been able to do so much together sep we now stand ten years past the midpoint of a century that has witnessed four major wars among great nations sep three of these involved our own country sep despite these holocausts, america is today the strongest, the most influential, and most productive nation in the world sep understandably proud of this pre-eminence, we yet realize that america's leadership and prestige depend, not merely upon our unmatched material progress, riches, and military strength, but on how we use our power in the interests of world peace and human betterment sep throughout america's adventure in free government, our basic purposes have been to keep the peace, to foster progress in human achievement, and to enhance liberty, dignity, and integrity among peoples and among nations sep to strive for less would be unworthy of a free and religious people sep any failure traceable to arrogance, or our lack of comprehension, or readiness to sacrifice would inflict upon us grievous hurt, both at home and abroad sep progress toward these noble goals is persistently threatened by the conflict now engulfing the world sep it commands our whole attention, absorbs our very beings sep we face a hostile ideology global in scope, atheistic in character, ruthless in purpose, and insiduous [insidious] in method sep unhappily, the danger it poses promises to be of indefinite duration sep to meet it successfully, there is called for, not so much the emotional and transitory sacrifices of crisis, but rather those which enable us to carry forward steadily, surely, and without complaint the burdens of a prolonged and complex struggle with liberty the stake sep only thus shall we remain, despite every provocation, on our charted course toward permanent peace and human betterment sep crises there will continue to be sep in meeting them, whether foreign or domestic, great or small, there is a recurring temptation to feel that some spectacular and costly action could become the miraculous solution to all current difficulties sep a huge increase in newer elements of our defenses; development of unrealistic programs to cure every ill in agriculture; a dramatic expansion in basic and applied research -- these and many other possibilities, each possibly promising in itself, may be suggested as the only way to the road we wish to travel sep but each proposal must be weighed in the light of a broader consideration: the need to maintain balance in and among national programs, balance between the private and the public economy, balance between the cost and hoped for advantages, balance between the clearly necessary and the comfortably desirable, balance between our essential requirements as a nation and the duties imposed by the nation upon the individual, balance between actions of the moment and the national welfare of the future sep good judgment seeks balance and progress sep lack of it eventually finds imbalance and frustration sep the record of many decades stands as proof that our people and their government have, in the main, understood these truths and have responded to them well, in the face of threat and stress sep but threats, new in kind or degree, constantly arise sep of these, i mention two only sep a vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment sep our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction sep our military organization today bears little relation to that known of any of my predecessors in peacetime, or, indeed, by the fighting men of world war ii or korea sep until the latest of our world conflicts, the united states had no armaments industry sep american makers of plowshares could, with time and as required, make swords as well sep but we can no longer risk emergency improvisation of national defense sep we have been compelled to create a permanent armaments industry of vast proportions sep added to this, three and a half million men and women are directly engaged in the defense establishment sep we annually spend on military security alone more than the net income of all united states cooperations -- corporations sep now this conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the american experience sep the total influence -- economic, political, even spiritual -- is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government sep we recognize the imperative need for this development sep yet, we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications sep our toil, resources, and livelihood are all involved sep so is the very structure of our society sep in the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex sep the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist sep we must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes sep we should take nothing for granted sep only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals, so that security and liberty may prosper together sep akin to, and largely responsible for the sweeping changes in our industrial-military posture, has been the technological revolution during recent decades sep in this revolution, research has become central; it also becomes more formalized, complex, and costly sep a steadily increasing share is conducted for, by, or at the direction of, the federal government sep today, the solitary inventor, tinkering in his shop, has been overshadowed by task forces of scientists in laboratories and testing fields sep in the same fashion, the free university, historically the fountainhead of free ideas and scientific discovery, has experienced a revolution in the conduct of research sep partly because of the huge costs involved, a government contract becomes virtually a substitute for intellectual curiosity sep for every old blackboard there are now hundreds of new electronic computers sep the prospect of domination of the nation's scholars by federal employment, project allocations, and the power of money is ever present -- and is gravely to be regarded sep yet, in holding scientific research and discovery in respect, as we should, we must also be alert to the equal and opposite danger that public policy could itself become the captive of a scientific-technological elite sep it is the task of statesmanship to mold, to balance, and to integrate these and other forces, new and old, within the principles of our democratic system -- ever aiming toward the supreme goals of our free society sep another factor in maintaining balance involves the element of time sep as we peer into society's future, we -- you and i, and our government -- must avoid the impulse to live only for today, plundering for our own ease and convenience the precious resources of tomorrow sep we cannot mortgage the material assets of our grandchildren without risking the loss also of their political and spiritual heritage sep we want democracy to survive for all generations to come, not to become the insolvent phantom of tomorrow sep during the long lane of the history yet to be written, america knows that this world of ours, ever growing smaller, must avoid becoming a community of dreadful fear and hate, and be, instead, a proud confederation of mutual trust and respect sep such a confederation must be one of equals sep the weakest must come to the conference table with the same confidence as do we, protected as we are by our moral, economic, and military strength sep that table, though scarred by many past frustrations -- past frustrations, cannot be abandoned for the certain agony of disarmament -- of the battlefield sep disarmament, with mutual honor and confidence, is a continuing imperative sep together we must learn how to compose differences, not with arms, but with intellect and decent purpose sep because this need is so sharp and apparent, i confess that i lay down my official responsibilities in this field with a definite sense of disappointment sep as one who has witnessed the horror and the lingering sadness of war, as one who knows that another war could utterly destroy this civilization which has been so slowly and painfully built over thousands of years, i wish i could say tonight that a lasting peace is in sight sep happily, i can say that war has been avoided sep steady progress toward our ultimate goal has been made sep but so much remains to be done sep as a private citizen, i shall never cease to do what little i can to help the world advance along that road sep so, in this, my last good night to you as your president, i thank you for the many opportunities you have given me for public service in war and in peace sep i trust in that -- in that -- in that service you find some things worthy sep as for the rest of it, i know you will find ways to improve performance in the future sep you and i, my fellow citizens, need to be strong in our faith that all nations, under god, will reach the goal of peace with justice sep may we be ever unswerving in devotion to principle, confident but humble with power, diligent in pursuit of the nations' great goals sep to all the peoples of the world, i once more give expression to america's prayerful and continuing aspiration: we pray that peoples of all faiths, all races, all nations, may have their great human needs satisfied; that those now denied opportunity shall come to enjoy it to the full; that all who yearn for freedom may experience its few spiritual blessings sep those who have freedom will understand, also, its heavy responsibility; that all who are insensitive to the needs of others will learn charity; and that the sources -- scourges of poverty, disease, and ignorance will be made [to] disappear from the earth; and that in the goodness of time, all peoples will come to live together in a peace guaranteed by the binding force of mutual respect and love sep now, on friday noon, i am to become a private citizen sep i am proud to do so sep i look forward to it sep thank you, and good night
INTJ	gentlemen of the congress: i have called the congress into extraordinary session because there are serious, very serious, choices of policy to be made, and made immediately, which it was neither right nor constitutionally permissible that i should assume the responsibility of making sep on the third of february last i officially laid before you the extraordinary announcement of the imperial german government that on and after the first day of february it was its purpose to put aside all restraints of law or of humanity and use its submarines to sink every vessel that sought to approach either the ports of great britain and ireland or the western coasts of europe or any of the ports controlled by the enemies of germany within the mediterranean sep that had seemed to be the object of the german submarine warfare earlier in the war, but since april of last year the imperial government had somewhat restrained the commanders of its undersea craft in conformity with its promise then given to us that passenger boats should not be sunk and that due warning would be given to all other vessels which its submarines might seek to destroy, when no resistance was offered or escape attempted, and care taken that their crews were given at least a fair chance to save their lives in their open boats sep the precautions taken were meager and haphazard enough, as was proved in distressing instance after instance in the progress of the cruel and unmanly business, but a certain degree of restraint was observed sep the new policy has swept every restriction aside sep vessels of every kind, whatever their flag, their character, their cargo, their destination, their errand, have been ruthlessly sent to the bottom without warning and without thought of help or mercy for those on board, the vessels of friendly neutrals along with those of belligerents sep even hospital ships and ships carrying relief to the sorely bereaved and stricken people of belgium, though the latter were provided with safe conduct through the proscribed areas by the german government itself and were distinguished by unmistakable marks of identity, haven been sunk with the same reckless lack of compassion or of principle sep i was for a little while unable to believe that such things would in fact be done by any government that hitherto subscribed to the humane practices of civilized nations sep international law had its origin in the attempt to set up some law which would be respected and observed upon the seas, where no nation had right of dominion and where lay the free highways of the world sep by painful stage after stage has that law been built up, with meager enough results, indeed, after all was accomplished that could be accomplished, but always with a clear view, at least, of what the heart and conscience of mankind demanded sep this minimum of right the german government has swept aside under the plea of retaliation and necessity and because it had no weapons which it could use at sea except these which it is impossible to employ as it is employing them without throwing to the winds all scruples of humanity or of respect for the understandings that were supposed to underlie the intercourse of the world sep i am not now thinking of the loss of property involved, immense and serious as that is, but only of the wanton and wholesale destruction of the lives of non-combatants, men, women, and children, engaged in pursuits which have always, even in the darkest periods of modern history, been deemed innocent and legitimate sep property can be paid for; the lives of peaceful and innocent people cannot be sep the present german submarine warfare against commerce is a warfare against mankind sep it is war against all nations sep american ships have been sunk, american lives taken, in ways which it has stirred us very deeply to learn of, but the ships and people of other neutral and friendly nations have been sunk and overwhelmed in the waters in the same way sep there has been no discrimination sep the challenge is to all mankind sep each nation must decide for itself how it will meet it sep the choice we make for ourselves must be made with a moderation of counsel and temperateness of judgment befitting our character and our motives as a nation sep we must put excited feeling away sep our motive will not be revenge or the victorious assertion of the physical might of the nation, but only the vindication of right, of human right, of which we are only a single champion sep when i addressed the congress on the twenty-sixth of february last i thought that it would suffice to assert our neutral rights with arms, our right to use the seas against unlawful interference, our right to keep our people safe against unlawful violence sep but armed neutrality, it now appears, is impracticable sep because submarines are in effect outlaws when used as the german submarines have been used against merchant shipping, it is impossible to defend ships against their attacks as the law of nations has assumed that merchantmen would defend themselves against privateers or cruisers, visible craft giving chase upon the open sea sep it is common prudence in such circumstances, grim necessity indeed, to endeavor to destroy them before they have shown their own intention sep they must be dealt with upon sight, if dealt with at all sep the german government denies the right of neutrals to use arms at all within the areas of the sea which it has proscribed, even in the defense of rights which no modern publicist has ever before questioned their right to defend sep the intimation is conveyed that the armed guards which we have placed on our merchant ships will be treated as beyond the pale of law and subject to be dealt with as pirates would be sep armed neutrality is ineffectual enough at best; in such circumstances and in the face of such pretensions it is worse than ineffectual; it is likely only to produce what it was meant to prevent; it is practically certain to draw us into the war without either the rights or the effectiveness of belligerents sep there is one choice we cannot make, we are incapable of making: we will not choose the path of submission and suffer the most sacred rights of our nation and our people to be ignored or violated sep the wrongs against which we now array ourselves are no common wrongs: they cut to the very roots of human life sep with a profound sense of the solemn and even tragical character of the step i am taking and of the grave responsibilities which it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to what i deem my constitutional duty, i advise that the congress declare the recent course of the imperial german government to be in fact nothing less than war against the government and people of the united states; that it formally accept the status of belligerent which has thus been thrust upon it; and that it take immediate steps not only to put the country in a more thorough state of defense but also to exert all its power and employ all its resources to bring the government of the german empire to terms and end the war sep what this will involve is clear sep it will involve the utmost practicable cooperation in counsel and action with the governments now at war with germany, and, as incident to that, the extension to those governments of the most liberal financial credits, in order that our resources may so far as possible be added to theirs sep it will involve the organization and mobilization of all the material resources of the country to supply the materials of war and serve the incidental needs of the nation in the most abundant and yet the most economical and efficient way possible sep it will involve the immediate full equipment of the navy in all respects but particularly in supplying it with the best means of dealing with the enemys submarines sep it will involve the immediate addition to the armed forces of the united states already provided for by law in case of war at least five hundred thousand men, who should, in my opinion, be chosen upon the principle of universal liability to service, and also the authorization of subsequent additional increments of equal force so soon as they may be needed and can be handled in training sep it will involve also, of course, the granting of adequate credits to the government, sustained, i hope, so far as they can equitably be sustained by the present generation, by well conceived taxation sep i say sustained so far as may be equitable by taxation because it seems to me that it would be most unwise to base the credits which will now be necessary entirely on money borrowed sep it is our duty, i most respectfully urge, to protect our people so far as we may against the very serious hardships and evils which would be likely to arise out of the inflation which would be produced by vast loans sep in carrying out the measures by which these things are to be accomplished we should keep constantly in mind the wisdoms of interfering as little as possible in our own preparation and in the equipment of our own military forces with the duty -- for it will be a very practical duty -- of supplying the nations already at war with germany with the materials which they can obtain only from us or by our assistance sep they are in the field and we should help them in every way to be effective there sep i shall take the liberty of suggesting, through the several executive departments of the government, for the consideration of your committees, measures for the accomplishment of the several objects i have mentioned sep i hope that it will be your pleasure to deal with them as having been framed after very careful thought by the branch of the government upon which the responsibility of conducting the war safeguarding the nation will most directly fall sep while we do these things, these deeply momentous things, let us be very clear, and make very clear to all the world what our motives and our objects are sep my own thought has not been driven from its habitual and normal course by the unhappy events of the last two months, and i do not believe that the thought of the nation has been altered or clouded by them sep i have exactly the same things in mind now that i had in mind when i addressed the senate on the twenty-second of january last; the same that i had in mind when i addressed the congress on the third day of february and on the twenty-sixth of february sep our object now, as then, is to vindicate the principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power and to set up amongst the really free and self-governed peoples of the world such a concert of purpose and of action as will henceforth ensure the observance of those principles sep neutrality is no longer feasible or desirable where the peace of the world is involved and the freedom of its peoples, and the menace to that peace and freedom lies in the existence of autocratic governments backed by organized force which is controlled wholly by their will, not by the will of their people sep we have seen the last of neutrality in such circumstances sep we are at the beginning of an age in which it will be insisted that the same standards of conduct and responsibility for wrong done shall be observed among nations and their governments that are observed among the individual citizens of civilized states sep we have no quarrel with the german people sep we have no feeling towards them but one of sympathy and friendship sep it was not upon their impulse that their government acted in entering this war sep it was not with their previous knowledge or approval sep it was a war determined upon as wars used to be determined upon in the old, unhappy days when peoples were nowhere consulted by their rulers and wars were provoked and waged in the interest of dynasties or of little groups of ambitious men who were accustomed to use their fellow men as pawns and tools sep self-governed nations do not fill their neighbor states with spies or set the course of intrigue to bring about some critical posture of affairs which will give them an opportunity to strike and make conquest sep such designs can be successfully worked out only under cover and where no one has the right to ask questions sep cunningly contrived plans of deception or aggression, carried, it may be, from generation to generation, can be worked out and kept from the light only within the privacy of courts or behind carefully guarded confidences of a narrow and privileged class sep they are happily impossible where public opinion commands and insists upon full information concerning all the nations affairs sep a steadfast concert for peace can never be maintained except by a partnership of democratic nations sep no autocratic government could be trusted to keep faith within it or observe its covenants sep it must be a league of honor, a partnership of opinion sep intrigue would eat its vitals away; the plottings of inner circles who could plan what they would and render account to no one would be a corruption seated at its very heart sep only free peoples can hold their purpose and their honor steady to a common end and prefer the interests of mankind to any narrow interest of their own sep does not every american feel that assurance has been added to our hope for the future peace of the world by the wonderful and heartening things that have been happening within the last few weeks in russia sep russia was known by those who knew it best to have been always in fact democratic at heart, in all the vital habits of her thought, in all the intimate relationships of her people that spoke their natural instinct, their habitual attitude towards life sep the autocracy that crowned the summit of her political structure, long as it had stood and terrible as was the reality of its power, was not in fact russian in origin, character, or purpose; and now it has been shaken off and the great, generous russian people have been added in all their na sep ve majesty and might to the forces that are fighting for freedom in the world, for justice, and for peace sep here is a fit partner for a league of honor sep one of the things that has served to convince us that the prussian autocracy was not and could never be our friend is that from the very outset of the present war it has filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without, our industries and our commerce sep indeed it is now evident that its spies were here even before the war began; and it is unhappily not a matter of conjecture but a fact proved in our courts of justice that the intrigues which have more than once come perilously near to disturbing the peace and dislocating the industries of the country have been carried on at the instigation, wit the support, and even under the personal direction of official agents of the imperial government accredited to the government of the united states sep even in checking these things and trying to extirpate them we have sought to put the most generous interpretation possible upon them because we know that their source lay, not in any hostile feeling or purpose of the german people towards us (who were, no doubt, as ignorant of them as we ourselves were), but only in the selfish designs of a government that did what it pleased and told its people nothing sep but they have played their part in serving to convince us at last that that government entertains no real friendship for us and means to act against our peace and security at its convenience sep that it means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors that intercepted note to the german minister at mexico city is eloquent evidence sep we are accepting this challenge of hostile purpose because we know that in such a government, following such methods, we can never have a friend; and that in the presence of its organized power, always lying in wait to accomplish we know not what purpose, there can be no assured security of the democratic governments of the world sep we are now about to accept a gauge of battle with this natural foe to liberty and shall, if necessary, spend the whole force of the nation to check and nullify its pretensions and its power sep we are glad, now that we see the facts with no veil of false pretense about them, to fight thus for the ultimate peace of the world and for the liberation of its peoples, the german peoples included: for the rights of nations great and small and the privilege of men everywhere to choose their way of life and of obedience sep the world must be made safe for democracy sep its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty sep we have no selfish ends to serve sep we desire no conquest, no dominion sep we seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall cheerfully make sep we are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind sep we shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them sep just because we fight without rancor and without selfish object, seeking nothing for ourselves but what we shall wish to share with all free peoples, we shall, i feel confident, conduct our operations as belligerents without passion and ourselves observe with proud punctilio the principles of right and fair play we profess to be fighting for sep i have said nothing of the governments allied with the imperial government of germany because they have not made war upon us or challenged us to defend our right and our honor sep the austro-hungarian government has, indeed, avowed its unqualified endorsement and acceptance of the reckless and lawless submarine warfare adopted now without disguise by the imperial german government, and it has therefore not been possible for this government to receive count tarnowski, the ambassador recently accredited to this government by the imperial and royal government of austria-hungary; but that government has not actually engaged in warfare against citizens of the united states on the seas, and i take the liberty, for the present at least, of postponing a discussion of our relations with the authorities at vienna sep we enter this war only where we are clearly forced into it because there are no other means of defending our rights sep it will be all the easier for us to conduct ourselves as belligerents in a high spirit of right and fairness because we act without animus, not in enmity towards a people or with the desire to bring any injury or disadvantage upon them, but only armed opposition to an irresponsible government which has thrown aside all considerations of humanity and of right and is running amuck sep we are, let me say again, the sincere friends of the german people, and shall desire nothing so much as the early reestablishment of intimate relations of mutual advantage between us -- however hard it may be for them, for the time being, to believe that this is spoken from our hearts sep we have borne with their present government through all these bitter months because of that friendship -- exercising a patience and forbearance which would otherwise have been impossible sep we shall, happily, still have an opportunity to prove that friendship in our daily attitude and actions towards the millions of men and women of german birth and native sympathy who live amongst us and share our life, and we shall be proud to prove it towards all who are in fact loyal to their neighbors and to the government in the hour of test sep they are, most of them, as true and loyal americans as if they had never known any other fealty or allegiance sep they will be prompt to stand with us in rebuking and restraining the few who may be of a different mind and purpose sep if there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with a firm hand of stern repression; but, if it lifts its head at all, it will lift it only here and there and without countenance except from a lawless and malignant few sep it is a distressing and oppressive duty, gentlemen of the congress, which i have performed in thus addressing you sep there are, it may be, many months of fiery trial and sacrifice ahead of us sep it is a fearful thing to lead this great peaceful people into war, into the most terrible and disastrous of all wars, civilization itself seeming t
ESTP	general westmoreland, general grove, distinguished guests, and gentlemen of the corps sep as i was leaving the hotel this morning, a doorman asked me, "where are you bound for, general sep " and when i replied, "west point," he remarked, "beautiful place sep have you ever been there before sep "no human being could fail to be deeply moved by such a tribute as this [thayer award] sep coming from a profession i have served so long, and a people i have loved so well, it fills me with an emotion i cannot express sep but this award is not intended primarily to honor a personality, but to symbolize a great moral code -- the code of conduct and chivalry of those who guard this beloved land of culture and ancient descent sep that is the animation of this medallion sep for all eyes and for all time, it is an expression of the ethics of the american soldier sep that i should be integrated in this way with so noble an ideal arouses a sense of pride and yet of humility which will be with me always sep duty, honor, country: those three hallowed words reverently dictate what you ought to be, what you can be, what you will be sep they are your rallying points: to build courage when courage seems to fail; to regain faith when there seems to be little cause for faith; to create hope when hope becomes forlorn sep unhappily, i possess neither that eloquence of diction, that poetry of imagination, nor that brilliance of metaphor to tell you all that they mean sep the unbelievers will say they are but words, but a slogan, but a flamboyant phrase sep every pedant, every demagogue, every cynic, every hypocrite, every troublemaker, and i am sorry to say, some others of an entirely different character, will try to downgrade them even to the extent of mockery and ridicule sep but these are some of the things they do: they build your basic character sep they mold you for your future roles as the custodians of the nation's defense sep they make you strong enough to know when you are weak, and brave enough to face yourself when you are afraid sep they teach you to be proud and unbending in honest failure, but humble and gentle in success; not to substitute words for actions, not to seek the path of comfort, but to face the stress and spur of difficulty and challenge; to learn to stand up in the storm but to have compassion on those who fall; to master yourself before you seek to master others; to have a heart that is clean, a goal that is high; to learn to laugh, yet never forget how to weep; to reach into the future yet never neglect the past; to be serious yet never to take yourself too seriously; to be modest so that you will remember the simplicity of true greatness, the open mind of true wisdom, the meekness of true strength sep they give you a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a vigor of the emotions, a freshness of the deep springs of life, a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of an appetite for adventure over love of ease sep they create in your heart the sense of wonder, the unfailing hope of what next, and the joy and inspiration of life sep they teach you in this way to be an officer and a gentleman sep and what sort of soldiers are those you are to lead sep are they reliable sep are they brave sep are they capable of victory sep their story is known to all of you sep it is the story of the american man-at-arms sep my estimate of him was formed on the battlefield many, many years ago, and has never changed sep i regarded him then as i regard him now -- as one of the world's noblest figures, not only as one of the finest military characters, but also as one of the most stainless sep his name and fame are the birthright of every american citizen sep in his youth and strength, his love and loyalty, he gave all that mortality can give sep he needs no eulogy from me or from any other man sep he has written his own history and written it in red on his enemy's breast sep but when i think of his patience under adversity, of his courage under fire, and of his modesty in victory, i am filled with an emotion of admiration i cannot put into words sep he belongs to history as furnishing one of the greatest examples of successful patriotism sep he belongs to posterity as the instructor of future generations in the principles of liberty and freedom sep he belongs to the present, to us, by his virtues and by his achievements sep in 20 campaigns, on a hundred battlefields, around a thousand campfires, i have witnessed that enduring fortitude, that patriotic self-abnegation, and that invincible determination which have carved his statue in the hearts of his people sep from one end of the world to the other he has drained deep the chalice of courage sep as i listened to those songs [from the glee club], in memory's eye i could see those staggering columns of the first world war, bending under soggy packs, on many a weary march from dripping dusk to drizzling dawn, slogging ankle-deep through the mire of shell-shocked roads, to form grimly for the attack, blue-lipped, covered with sludge and mud, chilled by the wind and rain, driving home to their objective, and for many, to the judgment seat of god sep i do not know the dignity of their birth, but i do know the glory of their death sep they died unquestioning, uncomplaining, with faith in their hearts, and on their lips the hope that we would go on to victory sep always, for them: duty, honor, country; always their blood and sweat and tears, as we sought the way and the light and the truth sep and 20 years after, on the other side of the globe, again the filth of murky foxholes, the stench of ghostly trenches, the slime of dripping dugouts; those boiling suns of relentless heat, those torrential rains of devastating storms; the loneliness and utter desolation of jungle trails; the bitterness of long separation from those they loved and cherished; the deadly pestilence of tropical disease; the horror of stricken areas of war; their resolute and determined defense, their swift and sure attack, their indomitable purpose, their complete and decisive victory -- always victory sep always through the bloody haze of their last reverberating shot, the vision of gaunt, ghastly men reverently following your password of: duty, honor, country sep the code which those words perpetuate embraces the highest moral laws and will stand the test of any ethics or philosophies ever promulgated for the uplift of mankind sep its requirements are for the things that are right, and its restraints are from the things that are wrong sep the soldier, above all other men, is required to practice the greatest act of religious training -- sacrifice sep in battle and in the face of danger and death, he discloses those divine attributes which his maker gave when he created man in his own image sep no physical courage and no brute instinct can take the place of the divine help which alone can sustain him sep however horrible the incidents of war may be, the soldier who is called upon to offer and to give his life for his country is the noblest development of mankind sep you now face a new world -- a world of change sep the thrust into outer space of the satellite, spheres, and missiles mark the beginning of another epoch in the long story of mankind sep in the five or more billions of years the scientists tell us it has taken to form the earth, in the three or more billion years of development of the human race, there has never been a more abrupt or staggering evolution sep we deal now not with things of this world alone, but with the illimitable distances and as yet unfathomed mysteries of the universe sep we are reaching out for a new and boundless frontier sep we speak in strange terms: of harnessing the cosmic energy; of making winds and tides work for us; of creating unheard synthetic materials to supplement or even replace our old standard basics; to purify sea water for our drink; of mining ocean floors for new fields of wealth and food; of disease preventatives to expand life into the hundreds of years; of controlling the weather for a more equitable distribution of heat and cold, of rain and shine; of space ships to the moon; of the primary target in war, no longer limited to the armed forces of an enemy, but instead to include his civil populations; of ultimate conflict between a united human race and the sinister forces of some other planetary galaxy; of such dreams and fantasies as to make life the most exciting of all time sep and through all this welter of change and development, your mission remains fixed, determined, inviolable: it is to win our wars sep everything else in your professional career is but corollary to this vital dedication sep all other public purposes, all other public projects, all other public needs, great or small, will find others for their accomplishment sep but you are the ones who are trained to fight sep yours is the profession of arms, the will to win, the sure knowledge that in war there is no substitute for victory; that if you lose, the nation will be destroyed; that the very obsession of your public service must be: duty, honor, country sep others will debate the controversial issues, national and international, which divide men's minds; but serene, calm, aloof, you stand as the nation's war-guardian, as its lifeguard from the raging tides of international conflict, as its gladiator in the arena of battle sep for a century and a half you have defended, guarded, and protected its hallowed traditions of liberty and freedom, of right and justice sep let civilian voices argue the merits or demerits of our processes of government; whether our strength is being sapped by deficit financing, indulged in too long, by federal paternalism grown too mighty, by power groups grown too arrogant, by politics grown too corrupt, by crime grown too rampant, by morals grown too low, by taxes grown too high, by extremists grown too violent;

ISTJ	good evening, my fellow americans sep tonight i want to talk to you on a subject of deep concern to all americans and to many people in all parts of the world, the war in vietnam sep i believe that one of the reasons for the deep division about vietnam is that many americans have lost confidence in what their government has told them about our policy sep the american people cannot and should not be asked to support a policy which involves the overriding issues of war and peace unless they know the truth about that policy sep tonight, therefore, i would like to answer some of the questions that i know are on the minds of many of you listening to me sep how and why did america get involved in vietnam in the first place sep how has this administration changed the policy of the previous administration sep what has really happened in the negotiations in paris and on the battlefront in vietnam sep what choices do we have if we are to end the war sep what are the prospects for peace sep now let me begin by describing the situation i found when i was inaugurated on january 20: the war had been going on for four years sep thirty-one thousand americans had been killed in action sep the training program for the south vietnamese was beyond [behind] schedule sep five hundred and forty-thousand americans were in vietnam with no plans to reduce the number sep no progress had been made at the negotiations in paris and the united states had not put forth a comprehensive peace proposal sep the war was causing deep division at home and criticism from many of our friends, as well as our enemies, abroad sep in view of these circumstances, there were some who urged that i end the war at once by ordering the immediate withdrawal of all american forces sep from a political standpoint, this would have been a popular and easy course to follow sep after all, we became involved in the war while my predecessor was in office sep i could blame the defeat, which would be the result of my action, on him -- and come out as the peacemaker sep some put it to me quite bluntly: this was the only way to avoid allowing johnsons war to become nixons war sep but i had a greater obligation than to think only of the years of my administration, and of the next election sep i had to think of the effect of my decision on the next generation, and on the future of peace and freedom in america, and in the world sep let us all understand that the question before us is not whether some americans are for peace and some americans are against peace sep the question at issue is not whether johnsons war becomes nixons war sep the great question is: how can we win americas peace sep well, let us turn now to the fundamental issue: why and how did the united states become involved in vietnam in the first place sep fifteen years ago north vietnam, with the logistical support of communist china and the soviet union, launched a campaign to impose a communist government on south vietnam by instigating and supporting a revolution sep in response to the request of the government of south vietnam, president eisenhower sent economic aid and military equipment to assist the people of south vietnam in their efforts to prevent a communist takeover sep seven years ago, president kennedy sent 16,000 military personnel to vietnam as combat advisers sep four years ago, president johnson sent american combat forces to south vietnam sep now many believe that president johnsons decision to send american combat forces to south vietnam was wrong sep and many others, i among them, have been strongly critical of the way the war has been conducted sep but the question facing us today is: now that we are in the war, what is the best way to end it sep in january i could only conclude that the precipitate withdrawal of all american forces from vietnam would be a disaster not only for south vietnam but for the united states and for the cause of peace sep for the south vietnamese, our precipitate withdrawal would inevitably allow the communists to repeat the massacres which followed their takeover in the"orth 15 years before sep they then murdered more than 50,000 people and hundreds of thousands more died in slave labor camps sep we saw a prelude of what would happen in south vietnam when the communists entered the city of hue last year sep during their brief rule there, there was a bloody reign of terror in which 3,000 civilians were clubbed, shot to death, and buried in mass graves sep with the sudden collapse of our support, these atrocities at hue would become the nightmare of the entire nation and particularly for the million-and-a half catholic refugees who fled to south vietnam when the communists took over in the north sep for the united states this first defeat in our nations history would result in a collapse of confidence in american leadership not only in asia but throughout the world sep three american presidents have recognized the great stakes involved in vietnam and understood what had to be done sep in 1963 president kennedy with his characteristic eloquence and clarity said,"e want to see a stable government there," carrying on the [a] struggle to maintain its national independence sep " we believe strongly in that sep we are not going to withdraw from that effort sep in my opinion, for us to withdraw from that effort would mean a collapse not only of south vietnam but southeast asia sep so were going to stay there sep "president eisenhower and president johnson expressed the same conclusion during their terms of office sep for the future of peace, precipitate withdrawal would be a disaster of immense magnitude sep a nation cannot remain great if it betrays its allies and lets down its friends sep our defeat and humiliation in south vietnam without question would promote recklessness in the councils of those great powers who have not yet abandoned their goals of worlds conquest sep this would spark violence wherever our commitments help maintain the peace -- in the middle east, in berlin, eventually even in the western hemisphere sep ultimately, this would cost more lives sep it would not bring peace sep it would bring more war sep for these reasons i rejected the recommendation that i should end the war by immediately withdrawing all of our forces sep i chose instead to change american policy on both the negotiating front and the battle front in order to end the war fought on many fronts sep i initiated a pursuit for peace on many fronts sep in a television speech on may 14, in a speech before the united nations, on a number of other occasions, i set forth our peace proposals in great detail sep we have offered the complete withdrawal of all outside forces within one year sep we have proposed a cease fire under international supervision sep we have offered free elections under international supervision with the communists participating in the organization and conduct of the elections as an organized political force sep and the saigon government has pledged to accept the result of the election sep we have not put forth our proposals on a take-it-or-leave-it basis sep we have indicated that were willing to discuss the proposals that have been put forth by the other side sep we have declared that anything is negotiable, except the right of the people of south vietnam to determine their own future sep at the paris peace conference ambassador lodge has demonstrated our flexibility and good faith in 40 public meetings sep hanoi has refused even to discuss our proposals sep they demand our unconditional acceptance of their terms which are that we withdraw all american forces immediately and unconditionally and that we overthrow the government of south vietnam as we leave sep we have not limited our peace initiatives to public forums and public statements sep i recognized in january that a long and bitter war like this usually cannot be settled in a public forum sep that is why in addition to the public statements and negotiations, i have explored every possible private avenue that might lead to a settlement sep tonight, i am taking the unprecedented step of disclosing to you some of our other initiatives for peace, initiatives we undertook privately and secretly because we thought we thereby might open a door which publicly would be closed sep i did not wait for my inauguration to begin my quest for peace sep soon after my election, through an individual who was directly in contact on a personal basis with the leaders of north vietnam, i made two private offers for a rapid, comprehensive settlement sep hanois replies called in effect for our surrender before negotiations sep since the soviet union furnishes most of the military equipment for north vietnam, secretary of state rogers, my assistant for national security affairs, dr sep kissinger, ambassador lodge and i personally have met on a number of occasions with representatives of the soviet government to enlist their assistance in getting meaningful negotiations started sep in addition, we have had extended discussions directed toward that same end with representatives of other governments which have diplomatic relations with north vietnam sep none of these initiatives have to date produced results sep in mid-july i became convinced that it was necessary to make a major move to break the deadlock in the paris talks sep i spoke directly in this office, where im now sitting, with an individual who had known ho chi minh on a personal basis for 25 years sep through him i sent a letter to ho chi minh sep i did this outside of the usual diplomatic channels with the hope that with the necessity of making statements for propaganda removed, there might be constructive progress toward bringing the war to an end sep let me read from that letter to you now: dear mr sep president: i realize that it is difficult to communicate meaningfully across the gulf of four years of war sep but precisely because of this gulf i wanted to take this opportunity to reaffirm in all solemnity my desire to work for a just peace sep i deeply believe that the war in vietnam has gone on too long and delay in bringing it to an end can benefit no one, least of all the people of vietnam sep the time has come to move forward at the conference table toward an early resolution of this tragic war sep you will find us forthcoming and open-minded in a common effort to bring the blessings of peace to the brave people of vietnam sep let history record that at this critical juncture both sides turned their face toward peace rather than toward conflict and war sep i received ho chi minhs reply on august 30, three days before his death sep it simply reiterated the public position north vietnam had taken at paris and flatly rejected my initiative sep the full text of both letters is being released to the press sep in addition to the public meetings that i have referred to, ambassador lodge has met with vietnams chief negotiator in paris in 11 private sessions sep and we have taken other significant initiatives which must remain secret to keep open some channels of communications which may still prove to be productive sep but the effect of all the public, private, and secret negotiations which have been undertaken since the bombing halt a year ago, and since this administration came into office on january 20th, can be summed up in one sentence: no progress whatever has been made except agreement on the shape of the bargaining table sep well, now, whos at fault sep its become clear that the obstacle in negotiating an end to the war is not the president of the united states sep it is not the south vietnamese government sep the obstacle is the other sides absolute refusal to show the least willingness to join us in seeking a just peace sep and it will not do"o while it is convinced that all it has to do is to wait for our next concession, and our next concession after that one, until it gets everything it wants sep there can now be no longer any question that progress in negotiation depends only on hanoi s deciding to negotiate -- to negotiate seriously sep i realize t"t this report on our efforts on the diplomatic front is discouraging to the american people, but the american people are entitled to know the truth -- the bad news as well as the good news -- where the lives of our young men are involved sep now let me turn, however, to a more encouraging report on another front sep at the time we launched our search for peace, i recognized we might not succeed in bringing an end to the war through negotiations sep i therefore put into effect another plan to bring peace -- a plan which will bring the war to an end regardless of what happens on the negotiating front sep it is in line with the major shift in u sep s sep foreign policy which i described in my press conference at guam on july 25 sep let me briefly explain what has been described as the "nixon doctrine" -- a policy which not only will help end the war in vietnam but which is an essential element of our program to prevent future vietnams sep we americans are a do-it-yourself people -- were an impatient people sep instead of teaching someone else to do a job, we like to do it ourselves sep and this trait has been carried over into our foreign policy sep in korea, and again in vietnam, the united states furnished most of the money, most of the arms, and most of the men to help the people of those countries defend their freedom against communist aggression sep before any american troops were committed to vietnam, a leader of another asian country expressed this opinion to me when i was traveling in asia as a private citizen sep he said: when you are trying to assist another nation defend its freedom, u sep s sep policy should be to help them fight the war, but not to fight the war for them sep well in accordance with this wise counsel, i laid down in guam three principles as guidelines for future american policy toward asia sep first, the united states will keep all of its treaty commitments sep second, we shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us, or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security sep third, in cases involving other types of aggression we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested in accordance with our treaty commitments sep but we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense sep after i announced this policy, i found that the leaders of the philippines, thailand, vietnam, south korea, other nations which might be threatened by communist aggression, welcomed this new direction in american foreign policy sep the defense of freedom is everybodys business -- not just americas business sep and it is particularly the responsibility of the people whose freedom is threatened sep in the previous administration, we americanized the war in vietnam sep in this administration, we are vietnamizing the search for peace sep the policy of the previous administration not only resulted in our assuming the primary responsibility for fighting the war, but even more significant did not adequately stress the goal of strengthening the south vietnamese so that they could defend themselves when we left sep the vietnamization plan was launched following secretary lairds visit to vietnam in march sep under the plan, i ordered first a substantial increase in the training and equipment of south vietnamese forces sep in july, on my visit to vietnam, i changed general abramss orders, so that they were consistent with the objectives of our new policies sep under the new orders, the primary mission of our troops is to enable the south vietnamese forces to assume the full responsibility for the security of south vietnam sep our air operations have been reduced by over 20 per cent sep and now we have begun to see the results of this long-overdue change in american policy in vietnam sep after five years of americans going into vietnam we are finally bringing american men home sep by december 15 over 60,000 men will have been withdrawn from south vietnam, including 20 percent of all of our combat forces sep the south vietnamese have continued to gain in strength sep as a result, they've been able to take over combat responsibilities from our american troops sep two other significant developments have occurred since this administration took office sep enemy infiltration, infiltration which is essential if they are to launch a major attack over the last three months, is less than 20 percent of what it was over the same period last year sep and most important, united states casualties have declined during the last two months to the lowest point in three years sep let me now turn to our program for the future sep we have adopted a plan which we have worked out in cooperation with the south vietnamese for the complete withdrawal of all u sep s sep combat ground forces and their replacement by south vietnamese forces on an orderly scheduled timetable sep this withdrawal will be made from strength and not from weakness sep as south vietnamese forces become stronger, the rate of american withdrawal can become greater sep i have not, and do not, intend to announce the timetable for our program, and there are obvious reasons for this decision which im sure you will understand sep as ive indicated on several occasions, the rate of withdrawal will depend on developments on three fronts sep one of these is the progress which can be, or might be, made in the paris talks sep an announcement of a fixed timetable for our withdrawal would completely remove any incentive for the enemy to negotiate an agreement sep they would simply wait until our forces had withdrawn and then move in sep the other two factors on which we will base our withdrawal decisions are the level of enemy activity and the progress of the training programs of the south vietnamese forces sep and i am glad to be able to report tonight progress on both of these fronts has been greater than we anticipated when we started the program in june for withdrawal sep as a result, our timetable for withdrawal is more optimistic now than when we made our first estimates in june sep now this clearly demonstrates why it is not wise to be frozen in on a fixed timetable sep we must retain the flexibility to base each withdrawal decision on the situation as it is at that time, rather than on estimates that are no longer valid sep along with this optimistic estimate, i must in all candor leave one note of caution sep if the level of enemy activity significantly increases, we might have to adjust our timetable accordingly sep however, i want the record to be completely clear on one point sep at the time of the bombing halt just a year ago there was some confusion as to whether there was an understanding on the part of the enemy that if we stopped the bombing of north vietnam, they would stop the shelling of cities in south vietnam sep i want to be sure that there is no misunderstanding on the part of the enemy with regard to our withdrawal program sep we have noted the reduced level of infiltration, the reduction of our casualties and are basing our withdrawal decisions partially on those factors sep if the level of infiltration or our casualties increase while we are trying to scale down the fighting, it will be the result of a conscious decision by the enemy sep hanoi could make no greater mistake than to assume that an increase in violence will be to its advantage sep if i conclude that increased enemy action jeopardizes our remaining forces in vietnam, i shall not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation sep this is not a threat sep this is a statement of policy which as commander-in-chief of our armed forces i am making and meeting my responsibility for the protection of american fighting men wherever they may be sep my fellow americans, i am sure you can recognize from what i have said that we really only have two choices open to us if we want to end this war sep i can order an immediate precipitate withdrawal of all americans from vietnam without regard to the effects of that action sep or we can persist in our search for a just peace through a negotiated settlement, if possible, or through continued implementation of our plan for vietnamization, if necessary -- a plan in which we will withdraw all of our forces from vietnam on a schedule in accordance with our program as the south vietnamese become strong enough to defend their own freedom sep i have chosen this second course sep it is not the easy way sep it is the right way sep it is a plan which will end the war and serve the cause of peace, not just in vietnam but in the pacific and in the world sep in speaking of the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, i mentioned that our allies would lose confidence in america sep far more dangerous, we would lose confidence in ourselves sep oh, the immediate reaction would be a sense of relief that our men were coming home sep but as we saw the consequences of what we had done, inevitable remorse and divisive recrimination would scar our spirit as a people sep we have faced other crises in our history and we have become stronger by rejecting the easy way out and taking the right way in meeting our challenges sep our greatness as a nation has been our capacity to do what has to be done when we knew our course was right sep i recognize that some of my fellow citizens disagree with the plan for peace i have chosen sep honest and patriotic americans have reached different conclusions as to how peace should be achieved sep in san francisco a few weeks ago, i saw demonstrators carrying signs reading, lose in vietnam, bring the boys home sep well, one of the strengths of our free
ESFP	i am proud to come to this city as the guest of your distinguished mayor, who has symbolized throughout the world the fighting spirit of west berlin sep and i am proud -- and i am proud to visit the federal republic with your distinguished chancellor who for so many years has committed germany to democracy and freedom and progress, and to come here in the company of my fellow american, general clay, who -- who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed sep two thousand years ago -- two thousand years ago, the proudest boast was "civis romanus sum sep "1 today, in the world of freedom, the proudest boast is "ich bin ein berliner sep "(i appreciate my interpreter translating my german sep )there are many people in the world who really don't understand, or say they don't, what is the great issue between the free world and the communist world sep let them come to berlin sep there are some who say -- there are some who say that communism is the wave of the future sep let them come to berlin sep and there are some who say, in europe and elsewhere, we can work with the communists sep let them come to berlin sep and there are even a few who say that it is true that communism is an evil system, but it permits us to make economic progress sep lass' sie nach berlin kommen sep let them come to berlin sep freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect sep but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in -- to prevent them from leaving us sep i want to say on behalf of my countrymen who live many miles away on the other side of the atlantic, who are far distant from you, that they take the greatest pride, that they have been able to share with you, even from a distance, the story of the last 18 years sep i know of no town, no city, that has been besieged for 18 years that still lives with the vitality and the force, and the hope, and the determination of the city of west berlin sep while the wall is the most obvious and vivid demonstration of the failures of the communist system -- for all the world to see -- we take no satisfaction in it; for it is, as your mayor has said, an offense not only against history but an offense against humanity, separating families, dividing husbands and wives and brothers and sisters, and dividing a people who wish to be joined together sep what is -- what is true of this city is true of germany: real, lasting peace in europe can never be assured as long as one german out of four is denied the elementary right of free men, and that is to make a free choice sep in 18 years of peace and good faith, this generation of germans has earned the right to be free, including the right to unite their families and their nation in lasting peace, with good will to all people sep you live in a defended island of freedom, but your life is part of the main sep so let me ask you, as i close, to lift your eyes beyond the dangers of today, to the hopes of tomorrow, beyond the freedom merely of this city of berlin, or your country of germany, to the advance of freedom everywhere, beyond the wall to the day of peace with justice, beyond yourselves and ourselves to all mankind sep freedom is indivisible, and when one man is enslaved, all are not free sep when all are free, then we look -- can look forward to that day when this city will be joined as one and this country and this great continent of europe in a peaceful and hopeful globe sep when that day finally comes, as it will, the people of west berlin can take sober satisfaction in the fact that they were in the front lines for almost two decades sep all -- all free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of berlin sep and, therefore, as a free man, i take pride in the words --"ich bin ein berliner sep "
ESFP	thank you sep thank you very much sep thank you and good evening sep the sponsor has been identified, but unlike most television programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script sep as a matter of fact, i have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face in the next few weeks sep i have spent most of my life as a democrat sep i recently have seen fit to follow another course sep i believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines sep now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity sep the line has been used, "we've never had it so good sep "but i have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future sep no nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income sep today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in sep we haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years sep we've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world sep we have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce sep foreign dollar claims are 27 sep 3 billion dollars sep and we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value sep as for the peace that we would preserve, i wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in south vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely sep do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace sep there can be no real peace while one american is dying some place in the world for the rest of us sep we're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening sep well i think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the founding fathers sep not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from castro, and in the midst of his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, "we don't know how lucky we are sep " and the cuban stopped and said, "how lucky you are sep i had someplace to escape to sep " and in that sentence he told us the entire story sep if we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to sep this is the last stand on earth sep and this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man sep this is the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the american revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves sep you and i are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right sep well i'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right sep there's only an up or down: [up] man's old -- old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism sep and regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course sep in this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the "great society," or as we were told a few days ago by the president, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people sep but they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things i now will quote have appeared in print sep these are not republican accusations sep for example, they have voices that say, "the cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism sep " another voice says, "the profit motive has become outmoded sep it must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state sep " or, "our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century sep " senator fulbright has said at stanford university that the constitution is outmoded sep he referred to the president as "our moral teacher and our leader," and he says he is "hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document sep " he must "be freed," so that he "can do for us" what he knows "is best sep " and senator clark of pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as "meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government sep "well, i, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as "the masses sep " this is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in america sep but beyond that, "the full power of centralized government" -- this was the very thing the founding fathers sought to minimize sep they knew that governments don't control things sep a government can't control the economy without controlling people sep and they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose sep they also knew, those founding fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy sep now, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years sep since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled sep one-fourth of farming in america is responsible for 85% of the farm surplus sep three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21% increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce sep you see, that one-fourth of farming -- that's regulated and controlled by the federal government sep in the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow sep senator humphrey last week charged that barry goldwater, as president, would seek to eliminate farmers sep he should do his homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs sep he'll also find that the democratic administration has sought to get from congress [an] extension of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now free sep he'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government sep the secretary of agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals sep and contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil sep at the same time, there's been an increase in the department of agriculture employees sep there's now one for every 30 farms in the united states, and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for austria disappeared without a trace and billie sol estes never left shore sep every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but how -- who are farmers to know what's best for them sep the wheat farmers voted against a wheat program sep the government passed it anyway sep now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down sep meanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on sep private property rights [are] so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be sep in a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in cleveland, ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a "more compatible use of the land sep " the president tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds sep but fha [federal housing authority] and the veterans administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure sep for three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan sep the latest is the area redevelopment agency sep they've just declared rice county, kansas, a depressed area sep rice county, kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks sep and when the government tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed sep we have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one sep so they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning sep well, now, if government planning and welfare had the answer -- and they've had almost 30 years of it -- shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while sep shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help sep the reduction in the need for public housing sep but the reverse is true sep each year the need grows greater; the program grows greater sep we were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night sep well that was probably true sep they were all on a diet sep but now we're told that 9 sep 3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year sep welfare spending [is] 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the depression sep we're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare sep now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year sep and this added to their present income should eliminate poverty sep direct aid to the poor, however, is only running only about 600 dollars per family sep it would seem that someplace there must be some overhead sep now -- so now we declare "war on poverty," or "you, too, can be a bobby baker sep " now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have -- and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicates existing programs -- do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic sep well, in all fairness i should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated sep this is the youth feature sep we're now going to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the old ccc camps [civilian conservation corps], and we're going to put our young people in these camps sep but again we do some arithmetic, and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year sep we can send them to harvard for 2,700 sep course, don't get me wrong sep i'm not suggesting harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency sep but seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help sep not too long ago, a judge called me here in los angeles sep he told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce sep she had six children, was pregnant with her seventh sep under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month sep she wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise sep she's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the aid to dependent children program sep she got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing sep yet anytime you and i question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals sep they say we're always "against" things -- we're never "for" anything sep well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so sep now -- we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted social security as a step toward meeting the problem sep but we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood sep they've called it "insurance" to us in a hundred million pieces of literature sep but then they appeared before the supreme court and they testified it was a welfare program sep they only use the term "insurance" to sell it to the people sep and they said social security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, and the government has used that tax sep there is no fund, because robert byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that social security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole sep but he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble sep and they're doing just that sep a young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary -- his social security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65 sep the government promises 127 sep he could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than social security sep now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're due -- that the cupboard isn't bare sep barry goldwater thinks we can sep at the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years sep should we not allow a widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband sep shouldn't you and i be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do sep i think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds sep but i think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program, especially when we have such examples, as was announced last week, when france admitted that their medicare program is now bankrupt sep they've come to the end of the road sep in addition, was barry goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get your social security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, and not 45 cents worth sep i think we're for an international organization, where the nations of the world can seek peace sep but i think we're against subordinating american interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the general assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world's population sep i think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the soviet colonies in the satellite nations sep i think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world sep we set out to help 19 countries sep we're helping 107 sep we've spent 146 billion dollars sep with that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for haile selassie sep we bought dress suits for greek undertakers, extra wives for kenya[n] government officials sep we bought a thousand tv sets for a place where they have no electricity sep in the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country sep no government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size sep so, governments' programs, once launched, never disappear sep actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth sep federal employees -- federal employees number two and a half million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work force employed by government sep these proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards sep how many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant sep they can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury sep and they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine sep in chico county, arkansas, james wier over-planted his rice allotment sep the government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment sep and a u sep s sep marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction sep the government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work sep last february 19th at the university of minnesota, norman thomas, six-times candidate for president on the socialist party ticket, said, "if barry goldwater became president, he would stop the advance of socialism in the united states sep " i think that's exactly what he will do sep but as a former democrat, i can tell you norman thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, mr sep democrat himself, al smith, the great american, came before the american people and charged that the leadership of his party was taking the party of jefferson, jackson, and cleveland down the road under the banners of marx, lenin, and stalin sep and he walked away from his party, and he never returned til the day he died -- because to this day, the leadership of that party has been taking that party, that honorable party, down the road in the image of the labor socialist party of england sep now it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people sep what does it mean whether you hold the deed to the -- or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property sep and such machinery already exists sep the government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute sep every businessman has his own tale of harassment sep somewhere a perversion has taken place sep our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment sep our democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues sep they want to make you and i believe that this is a contest between two men -- that we're to choose just between two personalities sep well what of this man that they would destroy -- and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and i hold dear sep is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is sep well i've been privileged to know him "when sep " i knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and i can tell you personally i've never known a man in my life i believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing sep this is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it sep he put in health and medical insurance for all his employees sep he took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees sep he sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work sep he provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores sep when mexico was ravaged by the floods in the rio grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there sep an ex-gi told me how he met him sep it was the week before christmas during the korean war, and he was at the los angeles airport trying to get a ride home to arizona for christmas sep and he said that [there were] a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes sep and then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, "any men in uniform wanting a ride to arizona, go to runway such-and-such," and they went down there, and there was a fellow named barry goldwater sitting in his plane sep every day in those weeks before christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load sep during the hectic split-second timing of a campaign, this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer sep his campaign managers were understandably impatient, but he said, "there aren't many left who care what happens to her sep i'd like her to know i care sep " this is a man who said to his 19-year-old son, "there is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness, and when you begin to build your life on that rock, with the cement of the faith in god that you have, then you have a real start sep " this is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war sep and that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems i've discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war that must be won sep those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory sep they call their policy "accommodation sep " and they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us sep all who oppose them are indicted as warmongers sep they say we offer simple answers to complex problems sep well, perhaps there is a simple answer -- not an easy answer -- but simple: if you and i have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right sep we cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the iron curtain, "give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters sep " alexander hamilton said, "a nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one sep " now let's set the record straight sep there's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace -- and you can have it in the next second -- surrender sep admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face -- that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender sep if we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand -- the ultimatum sep and what then -- when nikita khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be sep he has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the cold war, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically sep he believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for "peace at any price" or "better red than dead," or as one commentator put it, he'd rather "live on his knees than die on his feet sep " and therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us sep you and i know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery sep if nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin -- just in the face of this enemy sep or should moses have told the children of israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs sep should christ have refused the cross sep should the patriots at concord bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world sep the martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the nazis didn't die in vain sep where, then, is the road to peace sep well it's a simple answer after all sep you and i have the courage to say to our enemies, "there is a price we will not pay sep " "there is a point beyond which they must not advance sep " and this -- this is the meaning in the phrase of barry goldwater's "peace through strength sep " winston churchill said, "the destiny of man is not measured by material computations sep when great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits -- not animals sep " and he said, "there's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty sep "you and i have a rendezvous with destiny sep we'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness sep we will keep in mind and remember that barry goldwater has faith in us sep he has faith that you and i have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny sep thank you very much
ENTJ	is that a right of life, when the young children of this country are being reared into a sphere which is more owned by 12 men that is by 120 million people sep ladies and gentlemen, i have only 30 minutes in which to speak to you this evening, and i, therefore, will not be able to discuss in detail so much as i can write when i have all of the time and space that is allowed me for the subjects, but i will undertake to sketch them very briefly without manuscript or preparation, so that you can understand them so well as i can tell them to you tonight sep i contend, my friends, that we have no difficult problem to solve in america, and that is the view of nearly everyone with whom i have discussed the matter here in washington and elsewhere throughout the united states -- that we have no very difficult problem to solve sep it is not the difficulty of the problem which we have; it is the fact that the rich people of this country -- and by rich people i mean the super-rich -- will not allow us to solve the problems, or rather the one little problem that is afflicting this country, because in order to cure all of our woes it is necessary to scale down the big fortunes, that we may scatter the wealth to be shared by all of the people sep we have a marvelous love for this government of ours; in fact, it is almost a religion, and it is well that it should be, because we have a splendid form of government and we have a splendid set of laws sep we have everything here that we need, except that we have neglected the fundamentals upon which the american government was principally predicated sep how may of you remember the first thing that the declaration of independence said sep it said, "we hold these truths to be self-evident, that there are certain inalienable rights of the people, and among them are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"; and it said, further, "we hold the view that all men are created equal sep "now, what did they mean by that sep did they mean, my friends, to say that all me were created equal and that that meant that any one man was born to inherit $10,000,000,000 and that another child was to be born to inherit nothing sep did that mean, my friends, that someone would come into this world without having had an opportunity, of course, to have hit one lick of work, should be born with more than it and all of its children and children's children could ever dispose of, but that another one would have to be born into a life of starvation sep that was not the meaning of the declaration of independence when it said that all men are created equal of "that we hold that all men are created equal sep "now was it the meaning of the declaration of independence when it said that they held that there were certain rights that were inalienable -- the right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness sep is that right of life, my friends, when the young children of this country are being reared into a sphere which is more owned by 12 men than it is by 120,000,000 people sep is that, my friends, giving them a fair shake of the dice or anything like the inalienable right of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, or anything resembling the fact that all people are created equal; when we have today in america thousands and hundreds of thousands and millions of children on the verge of starvation in a land that is overflowing with too much to eat and too much to wear sep i do not think you will contend that, and i do not think for a moment that they will contend it sep now let us see if we cannot return this government to the declaration of independence and see if we are going to do anything regarding it sep why should we hesitate or why should we quibble or why should we quarrel with one another to find out what the difficulty is, when we know what the lord told us what the difficulty is, and moses wrote it out so a blind man could see it, then jesus told us all about it, and it was later written in the book of james, where everyone could read it sep i refer to the scriptures, now, my friends, and give you what it says not for the purpose of convincing you of the wisdom of myself, not for the purpose ladies and gentlemen, of convincing you of the fact that i am quoting the scripture means that i am to be more believed than someone else; but i quote you the scripture, rather refer you to the scripture, because whatever you see there you may rely upon will never be disproved so long as you or your children or anyone may live; and you may further depend upon the fact that not one historical fact that the bible has ever contained has ever yet been disproved by any scientific discovery or by reason of anything that has been disclosed to man through his own individual mind or through the wisdom of the lord which the lord has allowed him to have sep but the scripture says, ladies and gentlemen, that no country can survive, or for a country to survive it is necessary that we keep the wealth scattered among the people, that nothing should be held permanently by any one person, and that 50 years seems to be the year of jubilee in which all property would be scattered about and returned to the sources from which it originally came, and every seventh year debt should be remitted sep those two things the almighty said to be necessary -- i should say he knew to be necessary, or else he would not have so prescribed that the property would be kept among the general run of the people and that everyone would continue to share in it; so that no one man would get half of it and hand it down to a son, who takes half of what was left, and that son hand it down to another one, who would take half of what was left, until, like a snowball going downhill, all of the snow was off of the ground except what the snowball had sep i believe that was the judgment and the view and the law of the lord, that we would have to distribute wealth every so often, in order that there could not be people starving to death in a land of plenty, as there is in america today sep we have in american today more wealth, more goods, more food, more clothing, more houses than we have ever had sep we have everything in abundance here sep we have the farm problem, my friends, because we have too much cotton, because we have too much wheat, and have too much corn, and too much potatoes sep we have a home-loan problem because we have too many houses, and yet nobody can buy them and live in them sep we have trouble, my friends, in the country, because we have too much money owing, the greatest indebtedness that has ever been given to civilization, where it has been shown that we are incapable of distributing to the actual things that are here, because the people have not money enough to supply themselves with them, and because the greed of a few men is such that they think it is necessary that they own everything, and their pleasure consists in the starvation of the masses, and in their possessing things they cannot use, and their children cannot use, but who bask in the splendor of sunlight and wealth, casting darkness and despair and impressing it on everyone else sep "so, therefore," said the lord, in effect, "if you see these things that now have occurred and exist in this and other countries, there must be a constant scattering of wealth in any country if this country is to survive sep ""then," said the lord, in effect, "every seventh year there shall be a remission of debts; there will be no debts after 7 years sep " that was the law sep now, let us take america today sep we have in american today, ladies and gentlemen, $272,000,000,000 of debt sep two hundred and seventy-two thousand millions of dollars of debts are owed by the various people of this country today sep why, my friends, that cannot be paid sep it is not possible for that kind of debt to be paid sep the entire currency of the united states is only $6,000,000,000 sep that is all of the money that we have got in america today sep all the actual money you have got in all of your banks, all that you have got in the government treasury, is $6,000,000,000; and if you took all that money and paid it out today you would still owe $266,000,000,000; and if you took all that money and paid again you would still owe $260,000,000,000; and if you took it, my friends, 20 times and paid it you would still owe $150,000,000,000 sep you would have to have 45 times the entire money supply of the united states today to pay the debts of the people of america, and then they would just have to start out from scratch, without a dime to go on with sep so, my friends, it is impossible to pay all of these debts, and you might as well find out that it cannot be done sep the united states supreme court has definitely found out that it could not be done, because, in a minnesota case, it held that when a state has postponed the evil day of collecting a debt it was a valid and constitutional exercise of legislative power sep now, ladies and gentlemen, if i may proceed to give you some other words that i think you can understand -- i am not going to belabor you by quoting tonight -- i am going to tell you what the wise men of all ages and all times, down even to the present day, have all said: that you must keep the wealth of the country scattered, and you must limit the amount that any one man can own sep you cannot let any man own $300,000,000,000 or $400,000,000,000 sep if you do, one man can own all of the wealth that they united states has in it sep now, my friends, if you were off on an island where there were 100 lunches, you could not let one man eat up the hundred lunches, or take the hundred lunches and not let anybody else eat any of them sep if you did, there would not be anything else for the balance of the people to consume sep so, we have in america today, my friends, a condition by which about 10 men dominate the means of activity in at least 85 percent of the activities that you own sep they either own directly everything or they have got some kind of mortgage on it, with a very small percentage to be excepted sep they own the banks, they own the steel mills, they own the railroads, they own the bonds, they own the mortgages, they own the stores, and they have chained the country from one end to the other, until there is not any kind of business that a small, independent man could go into today and make a living, and there is not any kind of business that an independent man can go into and make any money to buy an automobile with; and they have finally and gradually and steadily eliminated everybody from the fields in which there is a living to be made, and still they have got little enough sense to think they ought to be able to get more business out of it anyway sep if you reduce a man to the point where he is starving to death and bleeding and dying, how do you expect that man to get hold of any money to spend with you sep it is not possible sep then, ladies and gentlemen, how do you expect people to live, when the wherewith cannot be had by the people sep in the beginning i quoted from the scriptures sep i hope you will understand that i am not quoting scripture to convince you of my goodness personally, because that is a thing between me and my maker, that is something as to how i stand with my maker and as to how you stand with your maker sep that is not concerned with this issue, except and unless there are those of you who would be so good as to pray for the souls of some of us sep but the lord gave his law, and in the book of james they said so, that the rich should weep and howl for the miseries that had come upon them; and, therefore, it was written that when the rich hold goods they could not use and could not consume, you will inflict punishment on them, and nothing but days of woe ahead of them sep then we have heard of the great greek philosopher, socrates, and the greater greek philosopher, plato, and we have read the dialog between plato and socrates, in which one said that great riches brought on great poverty, and would be destructive of a country sep read what they said sep read what plato said; that you must not let any one man be too poor, and you must not let any one man be too rich; that the same mill that grinds out the extra rich is the mill that will grind out the extra poor, because, in order that the extra rich can become so affluent, they must necessarily take more of what ordinarily would belong to the average man sep it is a very simple process of mathematics that you do not have to study, and that no one is going to discuss with you sep so that was the view of socrates and plato sep that was the view of the english statesmen sep that was the view of american statesmen sep that was the view of american statesmen like daniel webster, thomas jefferson, abraham lincoln, william jennings bryan, and theodore roosevelt, and even as late as herbert hoover and franklin d sep roosevelt sep both of these men, mr sep hoover and mr sep roosevelt, came out and said there had to be a decentralization of wealth, but neither one of them did anything about it sep but, nevertheless, they recognized the principle sep the fact that neither one of them ever did anything about it is their own problem that i am not undertaking to criticize; but had mr sep hoover carried out what he says ought to be done, he would be retiring from the president's office, very probably, 3 years from now, instead of 1 year ago; and had mr sep roosevelt proceeded along the lines that he stated were necessary for the decentralization of wealth, he would have gone, my friends, a long way already, and within a few months he would have probably reached a solution of all of the problems that afflict this country sep but i wish to warn you now that nothing that has been done up to this date has taken one dime away from these big-fortune holders; they own just as much as they did, and probably a little bit more; they hold just as many of the debts of the common people as they ever held, and probably a little bit more; and unless we, my friends, are going to give the people of this country a fair shake of the dice, by which they will all get something out of the funds of this land, there is not a chance on the topside of this god's eternal earth by which we can rescue this country and rescue the people of this country sep it is necessary to save the government of the country, but is much more necessary to save the people of america sep we love this country sep we love this government sep it is a religion, i say sep it is a kind of religion people have read of when women, in the name of religion, would take their infant babes and throw them into the burning flame, where they would be instantly devoured by the all-consuming fire, in days gone by; and there probably are some people of the world even today, who, in the name of religion, throw their tear-dimmed eyes into the sad faces of their fathers and mothers, who cannot given them food and clothing they both needed, and which is necessary to sustain them, and that goes on day after day, and night after night, when day gets into darkness and blackness, knowing those children would arise in the morning without being fed, and probably to bed at night without being fed sep yet in the name of our government, and all alone, those people undertake and strive as hard as they can to keep a good government alive, and how long they can stand that no one knows sep if i were in their place tonight, the place where millions are, i hope that i would have what i might say -- i cannot give you the word to express the kind of fortitude they have; that is the word -- i hope that i might have the fortitude to praise and honor my government that had allowed me here in this land, where there is too much to eat and too much to wear, to starve in order that a handful of men can have so much more than they can ever eat or they can ever wear sep now, we have organized a society, and we call it "share our wealth society," a society with the motto "every man a king sep "every man a king, so there would be no such thing as a man or woman who did not have the necessities of life, who would not be dependent upon the whims and caprices and ipsi dixit of the financial martyrs for a living sep what do we propose by this society sep we propose to limit the wealth of big men in the country sep there is an average of $15,000 in wealth to every family in america sep that is right here today sep we do not propose to divide it up equally sep we do not propose a division of wealth, but we propose to limit poverty that we will allow to be inflicted upon any man's family sep we will not say we are going to try to guarantee any equality, or $15,000 to families sep no; but we do say that one third of the average is low enough for any one family to hold, that there should be a guaranty of a family wealth of around $5,000; enough for a home, and automobile, a radio, and the ordinary conveniences, and the opportunity to educate their children; a fair share of the income of this land thereafter to that family so there will be no such thing as merely the select to have those things, and so there will be no such thing as a family living in poverty and distress sep we have to limit fortunes sep our present plan is that we will allow no one man to own more than $50,000,000 sep we think that with that limit we will be able to carry out the balance of the program sep it may be necessary that we limit it to less than $50,000,000 sep it may be necessary, in working out of the plans, that no man's fortune would be more than $10,000,000 or $15,000,000 sep but be that as it may, it will still be more than any one man, or any one man and his children and their children, will be able to spend in their lifetimes; and it is not necessary or reasonable to have wealth piled up beyond that point where we cannot prevent poverty among the masses sep another thing we propose is old-age pension of $30 a month for everyone that is 60 years old sep now, we do not give this pension to a man making $1,000 a year, and we do not give it to him if he has $10,000 in property, but outside of that we do sep we will limit hours of work sep there is not any necessity of having over-production sep i think all you have got to do, ladies and gentlemen, is just limit the hours of work to such an extent as people will work only so long as is necessary to produce enough for all of the people to have what they need sep why, ladies and gentleman, let us say that all of these labor-saving devices reduce hours down to where you do not have to work but 4 hours a day; that is enough for these people, and then praise be the name of the lord, if it gets that good sep let it be good and not a curse, and then we will have 5 hours a day and 5 days a week, or even less that that, and we might give a man a whole month off during a year, or give him 2 months; and we might do what other countries have seen fit to do, and what i did in louisiana, by having schools by which adults could go back and learn the things that have been discovered since they went to school sep we will not have any trouble taking care of the agricultural situation sep all you have to do is balance your production with your consumption sep you simply have to abandon a particular crop that you have too much of, and all you have to do is store the surplus for the next year, and the government will take it over sep when you have good crops in the area in which the crops that have been planted are sufficient for another year, put in your public works in the particular year when you do not need to raise any more, and by that means you get everybody employed sep when the government has enough of any particular crop to take care of all of the people, that will be all that is necessary; and in order to do all of this, our taxation is going to be to take the billion-dollar fortunes and strip them down to frying size, not to exceed $50,000,000, and it is necessary to come to $10,000,000, we will come to $10,000,000 sep we have worked the proposition out to guarantee a limit upon property (and no man will own less than one third the average), and guarantee a reduction of fortunes and a reduction of hours to spread wealth throughout this country sep we would care for the old people above 60 and take them away from this thriving industry and given them a chance to enjoy the necessities and live in ease, and thereby lift from the market the labor which would probably create a surplus of commodities sep those are the things we propose to do sep "every man a king sep " every man to eat when there is something to eat; all to wear something when there is something to wear sep that makes us all sovereign sep you cannot solve these things through these various and sundry alphabetical codes sep you can have the n sep r sep a sep and p sep w sep a sep and c sep w sep a sep and the u sep u sep g sep and g sep i sep n sep and any other kind of "dad-gummed" lettered code sep you can wait until doomsday and see 25 more alphabets, but that is not going to solve this proposition sep why hide sep why quibble sep you know what the trouble is sep the man that says he does not know what the trouble is just hiding his face to keep from seeing the sunlight sep god told you what the trouble was sep the philosophers told you what the trouble was; and when you have a country where one man owns more than 100,000 people, or a million people, and when you have a country where there are four men, as in america, that have got more control over things than all the 120,000,000 people together, you know what the trouble is sep we had these great incomes in this country; but the farmer, who plowed from sunup to sundown, who labored here from sunup to sundown for 6 days a week, wound up at the end of the with practically nothing sep and we ought to take care of the veterans of the wars in this program sep that is a small matter sep suppose it does cost a billion dollars a year -- that means that the money will be scattered throughout this country sep we ought to pay them a bonus sep we can do it sep we ought to take care of every single one of the sick and disabled veterans sep i do not care whether a man got sick on the battlefield or did not; every man that wore the uniform of this country is entitled to be taken care of, and there is money enough to do it; and we need to spread the wealth of the country, which you did not do in what you call the n sep r sep a sep if the n sep r sep a sep has done any good, i can put it all in my eye without having it hurt sep all i can see that n sep r sep a sep has done is to put the little man out of business -- the little merchant in his store, the little dago that is running a fruit stand, or the greek shoe-shining stand, who has to take hold of a code of 275 pages and study with a spirit level and compass and looking-glass; he has to hire a philadelphia lawyer to tell him what is in the code; and by the time he learns what the code is, he is in jail or out of business; and they have got a chain code system that has already put him out of business sep the n sep r sep a sep is not worth anything, and i said so when they put it through sep now, my friends, we have got to hit the root with the axe sep centralized power in the hands of a few, with centralized credit in the hands of a few, is the trouble sep get together in your community tonight or tomorrow and organize one of our share our wealth societies sep if you do not understand it, write me and let me send you the platform; let me give you the proof of it sep this is huey p sep long talking, united states senator, washington, d sep c sep write me and let me send you the data on this proposition sep enroll with us sep let us make known to the people what we are going to do sep i will send you a button, if i have got enough of them left sep we have got a little button that some of our friends designed, with our message around the rim of the button, and in the center "every man a king sep " many thousands of them are meeting through the united states, and every day we are getting hundreds and hundreds of letters sep share our wealth societies are now being organized, and people have it within their power to relieve themselves from this terrible situation sep look at what the mayo brothers announced this week, these greatest scientists of all the world today, who are entitled to have more money than all the morgans and the rockefellers, or anyone else, and yet the mayos turn back their big fortunes to be used for treating the sick, and said they did not want to lay up fortunes in this earth, but wanted to turn them back where they would do some good; but the other big capitalists are not willing to do that, are not willing to do what these men, 10 times more worthy, have already done, and it is going to take a law to require them to do it sep organize your share our wealth society and get your people to meet with you, and make known your wishes to your senators and representatives in congress sep now, my friends, i am going to stop sep i thank you for this opportunity to talk to you sep i am having to talk under the auspices and by the grace and permission of the national broadcasting system tonight, and they are letting me talk free sep if i had the money, and i wish i had the money, i would like to talk to you more often on this line, but i have not got it, and i cannot expect these people to give it to me free except on some rare instance sep but, my friends, i hope to have the opportunity to talk with you, and i am writing to you, and i hope that you will get up and help in the work, because the resolution and bills are before congress, and we hope to have your help in getting together and organizing your share our wealth society sep now, that i have but a minute left, i want to say that i suppose my family is listening in on the radio in new orleans, and i will say to my wife and three children that i am entirely well and hope to be home before many more days, and i hope they have listened to my speech tonight, and i wish them and all their neighbors and friends everything good that may be had sep i thank you, my friends, for your kind attention, and i hope you will enroll with us, take care of your own work in the work of this government, and share or help in our share our wealth society sep i thank you
ENTJ	my friends: this is not a fireside chat on war sep it is a talk on national security; because the nub of the whole purpose of your president is to keep you now, and your children later, and your grandchildren much later, out of a last-ditch war for the preservation of american independence, and all of the things that american independence means to you and to me and to ours sep tonight, in the presence of a world crisis, my mind goes back eight years to a night in the midst of a domestic crisis sep it was a time when the wheels of american industry were grinding to a full stop, when the whole banking system of our country had ceased to function sep i well remember that while i sat in my study in the white house, preparing to talk with the people of the united states, i had before my eyes the picture of all those americans with whom i was talking sep i saw the workmen in the mills, the mines, the factories, the girl behind the counter, the small shopkeeper, the farmer doing his spring plowing, the widows and the old men wondering about their life's savings sep i tried to convey to the great mass of american people what the banking crisis meant to them in their daily lives sep tonight, i want to do the same thing, with the same people, in this new crisis which faces america sep we met the issue of 1933 with courage and realism sep we face this new crisis, this new threat to the security of our nation, with the same courage and realism sep never before since jamestown and plymouth rock has our american civilization been in such danger as now sep for on september 27th, 1940 -- this year -- by an agreement signed in berlin, three powerful nations, two in europe and one in asia, joined themselves together in the threat that if the united states of america interfered with or blocked the expansion program of these three nations -- a program aimed at world control -- they would unite in ultimate action against the united states sep the nazi masters of germany have made it clear that they intend not only to dominate all life and thought in their own country, but also to enslave the whole of europe, and then to use the resources of europe to dominate the rest of the world sep it was only three weeks ago that their leader stated this: "there are two worlds that stand opposed to each other sep " and then in defiant reply to his opponents he said this: "others are correct when they say: 'with this world we cannot ever reconcile ourselves sep ''' i can beat any other power in the world sep " so said the leader of the nazis sep in other words, the axis not merely admits but the axis proclaims that there can be no ultimate peace between their philosophy -- their philosophy of government -- and our philosophy of government sep in view of the nature of this undeniable threat, it can be asserted, properly and categorically, that the united states has no right or reason to encourage talk of peace until the day shall come when there is a clear intention on the part of the aggressor nations to abandon all thought of dominating or conquering the world sep at this moment the forces of the states that are leagued against all peoples who live in freedom are being held away from our shores sep the germans and the italians are being blocked on the other side of the atlantic by the british and by the greeks, and by thousands of soldiers and sailors who were able to escape from subjugated countries sep in asia the japanese are being engaged by the chinese nation in another great defense sep in the pacific ocean is our fleet sep some of our people like to believe that wars in europe and in asia are of no concern to us sep but it is a matter of most vital concern to us that european and asiatic war-makers should not gain control of the oceans which lead to this hemisphere sep one hundred and seventeen years ago the monroe doctrine was conceived by our government as a measure of defense in the face of a threat against this hemisphere by an alliance in continental europe sep thereafter, we stood guard in the atlantic, with the british as neighbors sep there was no treaty sep there was no "unwritten agreement sep " and yet there was the feeling, proven correct by history, that we as neighbors could settle any disputes in peaceful fashion sep and the fact is that during the whole of this time the western hemisphere has remained free from aggression from europe or from asia sep does anyone seriously believe that we need to fear attack anywhere in the americas while a free britain remains our most powerful naval neighbor in the atlantic sep and does anyone seriously believe, on the other hand, that we could rest easy if the axis powers were our neighbors there sep if great britain goes down, the axis powers will control the continents of europe, asia, africa, austral-asia, and the high seas sep and they will be in a position to bring enormous military and naval resources against this hemisphere sep it is no exaggeration to say that all of us in all the americas would be living at the point of a gun -- a gun loaded with explosive bullets, economic as well as military sep we should enter upon a new and terrible era in which the whole world, our hemisphere included, would be run by threats of brute force sep and to survive in such a world, we would have to convert ourselves permanently into a militaristic power on the basis of war economy sep some of us like to believe that even if britain falls, we are still safe, because of the broad expanse of the atlantic and of the pacific sep but the width of those oceans is not what it was in the days of clipper ships sep at one point between africa and brazil the distance is less than it is from washington to denver, colorado, five hours for the latest type of bomber sep and at the north end of the pacific ocean, america and asia almost touch each other sep why, even today we have planes that could fly from the british isles to new england and back again without refueling sep and remember that the range of the modern bomber is ever being increased sep during the past week many people in all parts of the nation have told me what they wanted me to say tonight sep almost all of them expressed a courageous desire to hear the plain truth about the gravity of the situation sep one telegram, however, expressed the attitude of the small minority who want to see no evil and hear no evil, even though they know in their hearts that evil exists sep that telegram begged me not to tell again of the ease with which our american cities could be bombed by any hostile power which had gained bases in this western hemisphere sep the gist of that telegram was: "please, mr sep president, don't frighten us by telling us the facts sep " frankly and definitely there is danger ahead -- danger against which we must prepare sep but we well know that we cannot escape danger, or the fear of danger, by crawling into bed and pulling the covers over our heads sep some nations of europe were bound by solemn nonintervention pacts with germany sep other nations were assured by germany that they need never fear invasion sep nonintervention pact or not, the fact remains that they were attacked, overrun, thrown into modern slavery at an hour's notice -- or even without any notice at all sep as an exiled leader of one of these nations said to me the other day, "the notice was a minus quantity sep it was given to my government two hours after german troops had poured into my country in a hundred places sep " the fate of these nations tells us what it means to live at the point of a nazi gun sep the nazis have justified such actions by various pious frauds sep one of these frauds is the claim that they are occupying a nation for the purpose of "restoring order sep " another is that they are occupying or controlling a nation on the excuse that they are "protecting it" against the aggression of somebody else sep for example, germany has said that she was occupying belgium to save the belgians from the british sep would she then hesitate to say to any south american country: "we are occupying you to protect you from aggression by the united states" sep belgium today is being used as an invasion base against britain, now fighting for its life sep and any south american country, in nazi hands, would always constitute a jumping off place for german attack on any one of the other republics of this hemisphere sep analyze for yourselves the future of two other places even nearer to germany if the nazis won sep could ireland hold out sep would irish freedom be permitted as an amazing pet exception in an unfree world sep or the islands of the azores, which still fly the flag of portugal after five centuries sep you and i think of hawaii as an outpost of defense in the pacific sep and yet the azores are closer to our shores in the atlantic than hawaii is on the other side sep there are those who say that the axis powers would never have any desire to attack the western hemisphere sep that is the same dangerous form of wishful thinking which has destroyed the powers of resistance of so many conquered peoples sep the plain facts are that the nazis have proclaimed, time and again, that all other races are their inferiors and therefore subject to their orders sep and most important of all, the vast resources and wealth of this american hemisphere constitute the most tempting loot in all of the round world sep let us no longer blind ourselves to the undeniable fact that the evil forces which have crushed and undermined and corrupted so many others are already within our own gates sep your government knows much about them and every day is ferreting them out sep their secret emissaries are active in our own and in neighboring countries sep they seek to stir up suspicion and dissension, to cause internal strife sep they try to turn capital against labor, and vice versa sep they try to reawaken long slumbering racial and religious enmities which should have no place in this country sep they are active in every group that promotes intolerance sep they exploit for their own ends our own natural abhorrence of war sep these trouble-breeders have but one purpose sep it is to divide our people, to divide them into hostile groups and to destroy our unity and shatter our will to defend ourselves sep there are also american citizens, many of them in high places, who, unwittingly in most cases, are aiding and abetting the work of these agents sep i do not charge these american citizens with being foreign agents sep but i do charge them with doing exactly the kind of work that the dictators want done in the united states sep these people not only believe that we can save our own skins by shutting our eyes to the fate of other nations sep some of them go much further than that sep they say that we can and should become the friends and even the partners of the axis powers sep some of them even suggest that we should imitate the methods of the dictatorships sep but americans never can and never will do that sep the experience of the past two years has proven beyond doubt that no nation can appease the nazis sep no man can tame a tiger into a kitten by stroking it sep there can be no appeasement with ruthlessness sep there can be no reasoning with an incendiary bomb sep we know now that a nation can have peace with the nazis only at the price of total surrender sep even the people of italy have been forced to become accomplices of the nazis; but at this moment they do not know how soon they will be embraced to death by their allies sep the american appeasers ignore the warning to be found in the fate of austria, czechoslovakia, poland, norway, belgium, the netherlands, denmark, and france sep they tell you that the axis powers are going to win anyway; that all of this bloodshed in the world could be saved, that the united states might just as well throw its influence into the scale of a dictated peace and get the best out of it that we can sep they call it a "negotiated peace sep " nonsense sep is it a negotiated peace if a gang of outlaws surrounds your community and on threat of extermination makes you pay tribute to save your own skins sep for such a dictated peace would be no peace at all sep it would be only another armistice, leading to the most gigantic armament race and the most devastating trade wars in all history sep and in these contests the americas would offer the only real resistance to the axis power sep with all their vaunted efficiency, with all their parade of pious purpose in this war, there are still in their background the concentration camp and the servants of god in chains sep the history of recent years proves that the shootings and the chains and the concentration camps are not simply the transient tools but the very altars of modern dictatorships sep they may talk of a "new order" in the world, but what they have in mind is only a revival of the oldest and the worst tyranny sep in that there is no liberty, no religion, no hope sep the proposed "new order" is the very opposite of a united states of europe or a united states of asia sep it is not a government based upon the consent of the governed sep it is not a union of ordinary, self-respecting men and women to protect themselves and their freedom and their dignity from oppression sep it is an unholy alliance of power and pelf to dominate and to enslave the human race sep the british people and their allies today are conducting an active war against this unholy alliance sep our own future security is greatly dependent on the outcome of that fight sep our ability to "keep out of war" is going to be affected by that outcome sep thinking in terms of today and tomorrow, i make the direct statement to the american people that there is far less chance of the united states getting into war if we do all we can now to support the nations defending themselves against attack by the axis than if we acquiesce in their defeat, submit tamely to an axis victory, and wait our turn to be the object of attack in another war later on sep if we are to be completely honest with ourselves, we must admit that there is risk in any course we may take sep but i deeply believe that the great majority of our people agree that the course that i advocate involves the least risk now and the greatest hope for world peace in the future sep the people of europe who are defending themselves do not ask us to do their fighting sep they ask us for the implements of war, the planes, the tanks, the guns, the freighters which will enable them to fight for their liberty and for our security sep emphatically, we must get these weapons to them, get them to them in sufficient volume and quickly enough so that we and our children will be saved the agony and suffering of war which others have had to endure sep let not the defeatists tell us that it is too late sep it will never be earlier sep tomorrow will be later than today sep certain facts are self-evident sep in a military sense great britain and the british empire are today the spearhead of resistance to world conquest sep and they are putting up a fight which will live forever in the story of human gallantry sep there is no demand for sending an american expeditionary force outside our own borders sep there is no intention by any member of your government to send such a force sep you can therefore, nail, nail any talk about sending armies to europe as deliberate untruth sep our national policy is not directed toward war sep its sole purpose is to keep war away from our country and away from our people sep democracy's fight against world conquest is being greatly aided, and must be more greatly aided, by the rearmament of the united states and by sending every ounce and every ton of munitions and supplies that we can possibly spare to help the defenders who are in the front lines sep and it is no more un-neutral for us to do that than it is for sweden, russia, and other nations near germany to send steel and ore and oil and other war materials into germany every day in the week sep we are planning our own defense with the utmost urgency, and in its vast scale we must integrate the war needs of britain and the other free nations which are resisting aggression sep this is not a matter of sentiment or of controversial personal opinion sep it is a matter of realistic, practical military policy, based on the advice of our military experts who are in close touch with existing warfare sep these military and naval experts and the members of the congress and the administration have a single-minded purpose: the defense of the united states sep this nation is making a great effort to produce everything that is necessary in this emergency, and with all possible speed sep and this great effort requires great sacrifice sep i would ask no one to defend a democracy which in turn would not defend every one in the nation against want and privation sep the strength of this nation shall not be diluted by the failure of the government to protect the economic well-being of its citizens sep if our capacity to produce is limited by machines, it must ever be remembered that these machines are operated by the skill and the stamina of the workers sep as the government is determined to protect the rights of the workers, so the nation has a right to expect that the men who man the machines will discharge their full responsibilities to the urgent needs of defense sep the worker possesses the same human dignity and is entitled to the same security of position as the engineer or the manager or the owner sep for the workers provide the human power that turns out the destroyers, and the planes, and the tanks sep the nation expects our defense industries to continue operation without interruption by strikes or lockouts sep it expects and insists that management and workers will reconcile their differences by voluntary or legal means, to continue to produce the supplies that are so sorely needed sep and on the economic side of our great defense program, we are, as you know, bending every effort to maintain stability of prices and with that the stability of the cost of living sep nine days ago i announced the setting up of a more effective organization to direct our gigantic efforts to increase the production of munitions sep the appropriation of vast sums of money and a well-coordinated executive direction of our defense efforts are not in themselves enough sep guns, planes, ships and many other things have to be built in the factories and the arsenals of america sep they have to be produced by workers and managers and engineers with the aid of machines which in turn have to be built by hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the land sep in this great work there has been splendid cooperation between the government and industry and labor sep and i am very thankful sep american industrial genius, unmatched throughout all the world in the solution of production problems, has been called upon to bring its resources and its talents into action sep manufacturers of watches, of farm implements, of linotypes and cash registers and automobiles, and sewing machines and lawn mowers and locomotives, are now making fuses and bomb packing crates and telescope mounts and shells and pistols and tanks sep but all of our present efforts are not enough sep we must have more ships, more guns, more planes -- more of everything sep and this can be accomplished only if we discard the notion of "business as usual sep " this job cannot be done merely by superimposing on the existing productive facilities the added requirements of the nation for defense sep our defense efforts must not be blocked by those who fear the future consequences of surplus plant capacity sep the possible consequences of failure of our defense efforts now are much more to be feared sep and after the present needs of our defense are past, a proper handling of the country's peacetime needs will require all of the new productive capacity, if not still more sep no pessimistic policy about the future of america shall delay the immediate expansion of those industries essential to defense sep we need them sep i want to make it clear that it is the purpose of the nation to build now with all possible speed every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material sep we have the men, the skill, the wealth, and above all, the will sep i am confident that if and when production of consumer or luxury goods in certain industries requires the use of machines and raw materials that are essential for defense purposes, then such production must yield, and will gladly yield, to our primary and compelling purpose sep so i appeal to the owners of plants, to the managers, to the workers, to our own government employees to put every ounce of effort into producing these munitions swiftly and without stint sep with this appeal i give you the pledge that all of us who are officers of your government will devote ourselves to the same whole-hearted extent to the great task that lies ahead sep as planes and ships and guns and shells are produced, your government, with its defense experts, can then determine how best to use them to defend this hemisphere sep the decision as to how much shall be sent abroad and how much shall remain at home must be made on the basis of our overall military necessities sep we must be the great arsenal of democracy sep for us this is an emergency as serious as war itself sep we must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war sep we have furnished the british great material support and we will furnish far more in the future sep there will be no "bottlenecks" in our determination to aid great britain sep no dictator, no combination of dictators, will weaken that determination by threats of how they will construe that determination sep the british have received invaluable military support from the heroic greek army and from the forces of all the governments in exile sep their strength is growing sep it is the strength of men and women who value their freedom more highly than they value their lives sep i believe that the axis powers are not going to win this war sep i base that belief on the latest and best of information sep we have no excuse for defeatism sep we have every good reason for hope -- hope for peace, yes, and hope for the defense of our civilization and for the building of a better civilization in the future sep i have the profound conviction that the american people are now determined to put forth a mightier effort than they have ever yet made to increase our production of all the implements of defense, to meet the threat to our democratic faith sep as president of the united states, i call for that national effort sep i call for it in the name of this nation which we love and honor and which we are privileged and proud to serve sep i call upon our people with absolute confidence that our common cause will greatly succeed
ESFP	thank you sep thank you very much sep thank you very much sep thank you very much sep thank you very much sep and, reverend clergy all, senator hawkins, distinguished members of the florida congressional delegation, and all of you: i can't tell you how you have warmed my heart with your welcome sep i'm delighted to be here today sep those of you in the national association of evangelicals are known for your spiritual and humanitarian work sep and i would be especially remiss if i didn't discharge right now one personal debt of gratitude sep thank you for your prayers sep nancy and i have felt their presence many times in many ways sep and believe me, for us they've made all the difference sep the other day in the east room of the white house at a meeting there, someone asked me whether i was aware of all the people out there who were praying for the president sep and i had to say, "yes, i am sep i've felt it sep i believe in intercessionary prayer sep " but i couldn't help but say to that questioner after he'd asked the question that -- or at least say to them that if sometimes when he was praying he got a busy signal, it was just me in there ahead of him sep i think i understand how abraham lincoln felt when he said, "i have been driven many times to my knees by the overwhelming conviction that i had nowhere else to go sep " from the joy and the good feeling of this conference, i go to a political reception sep now, i don't know why, but that bit of scheduling reminds me of a story which i'll share with you sep an evangelical minister and a politician arrived at heaven's gate one day together sep and st sep peter, after doing all the necessary formalities, took them in hand to show them where their quarters would be sep and he took them to a small, single room with a bed, a chair, and a table and said this was for the clergyman sep and the politician was a little worried about what might be in store for him sep and he couldn't believe it then when st sep peter stopped in front of a beautiful mansion with lovely grounds, many servants, and told him that these would be his quarters sep and he couldn't help but ask, he said, "but wait, how -- there's something wrong -- how do i get this mansion while that good and holy man only gets a single room sep " and st sep peter said, "you have to understand how things are up here sep we've got thousands and thousands of clergy sep you're the first politician who ever made it sep "but i don't want to contribute to a stereotype sep so i tell you there are a great many god-fearing, dedicated, noble men and women in public life, present company included sep and yes, we need your help to keep us ever-mindful of the ideas and the principles that brought us into the public arena in the first place sep the basis of those ideals and principles is a commitment to freedom and personal liberty that, itself is grounded in the much deeper realization that freedom prospers only where the blessings of god are avidly sought and humbly accepted sep the american experiment in democracy rests on this insight sep its discovery was the great triumph of our founding fathers, voiced by william penn when he said: "if we will not be governed by god, we must be governed by tyrants sep " explaining the inalienable rights of men, jefferson said, "the god who gave us life, gave us liberty at the same time sep " and it was george washington who said that "of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports sep "and finally, that shrewdest of all observers of american democracy, alexis de tocqueville, put it eloquently after he had gone on a search for the secret of america's greatness and genius -- and he said: "not until i went into the churches of america and heard her pulpits aflame with righteousness did i understand the greatness and the genius of america sep america is good sep and if america ever ceases to be good, america will cease to be great sep "well, i'm pleased to be here today with you who are keeping america great by keeping her good sep only through your work and prayers and those of millions of others can we hope to survive this perilous century and keep alive this experiment in liberty, this last, best hope of man sep i want you to know that this administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of america in you, her people, and in your families, churches, neighborhoods, communities: the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under god sep now, i don't have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to, or at least out of step with, a -- a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modern-day secularism, discarding the tried and time-tested values upon which our very civilization is based sep no matter how well intentioned, their value system is radically different from that of most americans sep and while they proclaim that they're freeing us from superstitions of the past, they've taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation sep sometimes their voices are louder than ours, but they are not yet a majority sep an example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in washington sep and since i'm involved i've been waiting to hear from the parents of young america sep how far are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents sep let me state the case as briefly and simply as i can sep an organization of citizens, sincerely motivated, deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent, some time ago established a nationwide network of clinics to offer help to these girls and, hopefully, alleviate this situation sep now, again, let me say, i do not fault their intent sep however, in their well-intentioned effort, these clinics decided to provide advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their parents sep for some years now, the federal government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics sep in providing for this, the congress decreed that every effort would be made to maximize parental participation sep nevertheless, the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting parental consent or giving notification after they've done so sep girls termed "sexually active" -- and that has replaced the word "promiscuous" -- are given this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion sep well, we have ordered clinics receiving federal funds to notify the parents such help has been given sep one of the nation's leading newspapers has created the term "squeal rule" in editorializing against us for doing this, and we're being criticized for violating the privacy of young people sep a judge has recently granted an injunction against an enforcement of our rule sep i've watched tv panel shows discuss this issue, seen columnists pontificating on our error, but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex sep is all of judeo-christian tradition wrong sep are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm sep and isn't it the parents' right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives sep many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government sep we're going to fight in the courts sep the right of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of washington-based bureaucrats and social engineers sep but the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of american democracy sep freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under god is acknowledged sep when our founding fathers passed the first amendment, they sought to protect churches from government interference sep they never intended to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself sep the evidence of this permeates our history and our government sep the declaration of independence mentions the supreme being no less than four times sep "in god we trust" is engraved on our coinage sep the supreme court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation sep and the members of congress open their sessions with a prayer sep i just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the united states are entitled to the same privileges as supreme court justices and congressmen sep last year, i sent the congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools sep already this session, there's growing bipartisan support for the amendment, and i am calling on the congress to act speedily to pass it and to let our children pray sep perhaps some of you read recently about the lubbock school case, where a judge actually ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student groups, even when the group meetings were being held during the students' own time sep the first amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech sep senators denton and hatfield have proposed legislation in the congress on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech sep such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students sep and i hope the congress considers these bills quickly sep and with your help, i think it's possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the congress this year sep more than a decade ago, a supreme court decision literally wiped off the books of fifty states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children sep abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children a year sep human life legislation ending this tragedy will someday pass the congress, and you and i must never rest until it does sep unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity, then its right to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness must be protected sep you may remember that when abortion on demand began, many, and indeed, i'm sure many of you, warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life, that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life -- infanticide or mercy killing sep tragically enough, those warnings proved all too true sep only last year a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant sep i have directed the health and human services department to make clear to every health care facility in the united states that the rehabilitation act of 1973 protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps, including infants sep and we have taken the further step of requiring that each and every recipient of federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that "discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by federal law sep " it also lists a twenty-four-hour; toll-free number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infant's life sep in addition, recent legislation introduced by -- in the congress by representative henry hyde of illinois not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions, it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide sep i urge the congress to begin hearings and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children, including the disabled or handicapped sep now, i'm sure that you must get discouraged at times, but there you've done better than you know, perhaps sep there's a great spiritual awakening in america, a renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of america's goodness and greatness sep one recent survey by a washington-based research council concluded that americans were far more religious than the people of other nations; 95 percent of those surveyed expressed a belief in god and a huge majority believed the ten commandments had real meaning in their lives sep and another study has found that an overwhelming majority of americans disapprove of adultery, teenage sex, pornography, abortion, and hard drugs sep and this same study showed a deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief sep i think the items that we've discussed here today must be a key part of the nation's political agenda sep for the first time the congress is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the prayer and abortion issues and that's enormous progress right there sep i repeat: america is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal sep and with your biblical keynote, i say today, "yes, let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream sep "now, obviously, much of this new political and social consensus i've talked about is based on a positive view of american history, one that takes pride in our country's accomplishments and record sep but we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man sep we know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the phenomenology of evil or, as theologians would put it, the doctrine of sin sep there is sin and evil in the world, and we're enjoined by scripture and the lord jesus to oppose it with all our might sep our nation, too, has a legacy of evil with which it must deal sep the glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past sep for example, the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights, once a source of disunity and civil war is now a point of pride for all americans sep we must never go back sep there is no room for racism, anti-semitism, or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country sep i know that you've been horrified, as have i, by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice sep use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst sep the commandment given us is clear and simple: "thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself sep "but whatever sad episodes exist in our past, any objective observer must hold a positive view of american history, a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into reality sep especially in this century, america has kept alight the torch of freedom, but not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world sep and this brings me to my final point today sep during my first press conference as president, in answer to a direct question, i pointed out that, as good marxist-leninists, the soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause, which is world revolution sep i think i should point out i was only quoting lenin, their guiding spirit, who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas -- that's their name for religion -- or ideas that are outside class conceptions sep morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war sep and everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old, exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat sep well, i think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of soviet doctrine illustrates a historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are sep we saw this phenomenon in the 1930s sep we see it too often today sep this doesn't mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them sep i intend to do everything i can to persuade them of our peaceful intent, to remind them that it was the west that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the forties and fifties for territorial gain and which now proposes 50 percent cut in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of land-based, intermediate-range nuclear missiles sep at the same time, however, they must be made to understand we will never compromise our principles and standards sep we will never give away our freedom sep we will never abandon our belief in god sep and we will never stop searching for a genuine peace sep but we can assure none of these things america stands for through the so-called nuclear freeze solutions proposed by some sep the truth is that a freeze now would be a very dangerous fraud, for that is merely the illusion of peace sep the reality is that we must find peace through strength sep i would agree to a freeze if only we could freeze the soviets' global desires sep a freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the soviets to negotiate seriously in geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed sep instead, they would achieve their objectives through the freeze sep a freeze would reward the soviet union for its enormous and unparalleled military buildup sep it would prevent the essential and long overdue modernization of united states and allied defenses and would leave our aging forces increasingly vulnerable sep and an honest freeze would require extensive prior negotiations on the systems and numbers to be limited and on the measures to ensure effective verification and compliance sep and the kind of a freeze that has been suggested would be virtually impossible to verify sep such a major effort would divert us completely from our current negotiations on achieving substantial reductions sep a number of years ago, i heard a young father, a very prominent young man in the entertainment world, addressing a tremendous gathering in california sep it was during the time of the cold war, and communism and our own way of life were very much on people's minds sep and he was speaking to that subject sep and suddenly, though, i heard him saying, "i love my little girls more than anything sep " and i said to myself, "oh, no, don't sep you can't -- don't say that sep " but i had underestimated him sep he went on: "i would rather see my little girls die now; still believing in god, than have them grow up under communism and one day die no longer believing in god sep "there were thousands of young people in that audience sep they came to their feet with shouts of joy sep they had instantly recognized the profound truth in what he had said, with regard to the physical and the soul and what was truly important sep yes, let us pray for the salvation of all of those who live in that totalitarian darkness sep pray they will discover the joy of knowing god sep but until they do, let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state, declare its omnipotence over individual man, and predict its eventual domination of all peoples on the earth, they are the focus of evil in the modern world sep it was c sep s sep lewis who, in his unforgettable screw tape letters, wrote: "the greatest evil is not done now in those sordid 'dens of crime' that dickens loved to paint sep it is not even done in concentration camps and labor camps sep in those we see its final result sep but it is conceived and ordered; moved, seconded, carried and minuted in clear, carpeted, warmed, and well-lighted offices, by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smooth-shaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice sep "well, because these quiet men do not raise their voices, because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace, because, like other dictators before them, they're always making "their final territorial demand," some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses sep but if history teaches anything, it teaches that simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly sep it means the betrayal of our past, the squandering of our freedom sep so, i urge you to speak out against those who would place the united states in a position of military and moral inferiority sep you know, i've always believed that old screw tape reserved his best efforts for those of you in the church sep so, in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals, i urge you to beware the temptation of pride --the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault, to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire, to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong and good and evil sep i ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for our efforts, this administration's efforts, to keep america strong and free, while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the world's nuclear arsenals and one day, with god's help, their total elimination sep while america's military strength is important, let me add here that i've always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets, by armies or military might sep the real crisis we face today is a spiritual one; at root, it is a test of moral will and faith sep whittaker chambers, the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of the terrible traumas of our time, the hiss-chambers case, wrote that the crisis of the western world exists to the degree in which the west is indifferent to god, the degree to which it collaborates in communism's attempt to make man stand alone without god sep and then he said, for marxism-leninism is actually the second-oldest faith, first proclaimed in the garden of eden with the words of temptation, "ye shall be as gods sep "the western world can answer this challenge, he wrote, "but only provided that its faith in god and the freedom he enjoins is as great as communism's faith in man sep "i believe we shall rise to the challenge sep i believe that communism is another sad, bizarre chapter in human history whose last -- last pages even now are being written sep i believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material, but spiritual sep and because it knows no limitation, it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow man sep for in the words of isaiah: "he giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might he increased strength sep but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary sep "yes, change your world sep one of our founding fathers, thomas paine, said, "we have it within our power to begin the world over again sep " we can do it, doing together what no one church could do by itself sep god bless you and thank you very much
ESFP	senator hatfield, mr sep chief justice, mr sep president, vice president bush, vice president mondale, senator baker, speaker oneill, reverend moomaw, and my fellow citizens: to a few of us here today this is a solemn and most momentous occasion sep and, yet, in the history of our nation it is a commonplace occurrence sep the orderly transfer of authority as called for in the constitution routinely takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop to think how unique we really are sep in the eyes of many in the world, this every-four-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing less than a miracle sep mr sep president, i want our fellow citizens to know how much you did to carry on this tradition sep by your gracious cooperation in the transition process you have shown a watching world that we are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any other sep and i thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining the continuity which is the bulwark of our republic sep the business of our nation goes forward sep these united states are confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions sep we suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations in our national history sep it distorts our economic decisions, penalizes thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income elderly alike sep it threatens to shatter the lives of millions of our people sep idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, human misery and personal indignity sep those who do work are denied a fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity sep but great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public spending sep for decades we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging our future and our childrens future for the temporary convenience of the present sep to continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals sep you and i, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our means, but for only a limited period of time sep why then should we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that same limitation sep we must act today in order to preserve tomorrow sep and let there be no misunderstanding -- were going to begin to act beginning today sep the economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades sep they will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will go away sep they will go away because we as americans have the capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom sep in this present crisis, government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem sep from time to time weve been tempted to believe that society has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the people sep but if no one among us is capable of governing himself, then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else sep all of us together -- in and out of government -- must bear the burden sep the solutions we seek must be equitable with no one group singled out to pay a higher price sep we hear much of special interest groups sep well our concern must be for a special interest group that has been too long neglected sep it knows no sectional boundaries, or ethnic and racial divisions, and it crosses political party lines sep it is made up of men and women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us when were sick -- professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers, clerks, cabbies, and truck drivers sep they are, in short, we the people sep  this breed called americans sep well, this administrations objective will be a healthy, vigorous, growing economy that provides equal opportunities for all americans with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination sep putting america back to work means putting all americans back to work sep ending inflation means freeing all americans from the terror of runaway living costs sep all must share in the productive work of this new beginning, and all must share in the bounty of a revived economy sep with the idealism and fair play which are the core of our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous america at peace with itself and the world sep so as we begin, let us take inventory sep we are a nation that has a government -- not the other way around sep and this makes us special among the nations of the earth sep our government has no power except that granted it by the people sep it is time to check and reverse the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond the consent of the governed sep it is my intention to curb the size and influence of the federal establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between the powers granted to the federal government and those reserved to the states or to the people sep all of us -- all of us need to be reminded that the federal government did not create the states; the states created the federal government sep now, so there will be no misunderstanding, its not my intention to do away with government sep it is rather to make it work -- work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back sep government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster productivity, not stifle it sep if we look to the answer as to why for so many years we achieved so much, prospered as no other people on earth, it was because here in this land we unleashed the energy and individual genius of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before sep freedom and the dignity of the individual have been more available and assured here than in any other place on earth sep the price for this freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling to pay that price sep it is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government sep it is time for us"o realize that we are too great a nation to limit ourselves to small dreams sep we're not, as some would have us believe, doomed to an inevitable decline sep i do not believe in a fate that will fall on us no matter what we do sep i do believe in a fate that will fall on us if we do nothing sep so with all the creative energy at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal sep let us renew our determination, our courage, and our strength sep and let us renew our faith and our hope sep we have every right to dream heroic dreams sep those who say that were in a time when there are no heroes -- they just dont know where to look sep you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates sep others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed all of us and then the world beyond sep you meet heroes across a counter -- and theyre on both sides of that counter sep there are entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity sep there are individuals and families whose taxes support the government and whose voluntary gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education sep their patriotism is quiet but deep sep their values sustain our national life sep now i have used the words they and their in speaking of these heroes sep i could say you and your because im addressing the heroes of whom i speak -- you, the citizens of this blessed land sep your dreams, your hopes, your goals are going to be the"hopes, and the goals of this administration, so help me god sep we shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your make-up sep how can we love our country and not love our countrymen -- and loving them reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when theyre sick, and provide opportunity to make them self-sufficient so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory sep can we solve the problems confronting us sep well the answer is an unequivocal and emphatic "es sep " to paraphrase winston churchill, i did not take the oath ive just taken with the intention of presiding over the dissolution of the worlds strongest economy sep in the days ahead, i will propose removing the roadblocks that have slowed our economy and reduced productivity sep steps will be taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels of government sep progress may be slow -- measured in inches and feet, not miles -- but we will progress sep it is time to reawaken this industrial giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten our punitive tax burden sep and these will be our first priorities, and on these principles there will be no compromise sep on the eve or our struggle for independence a man who mightve been one of the greatest among the founding fathers, dr sep joseph warren, president of the massachusetts congress, said to his fellow americans,our country is in danger, but not to be despaired of sep on you depend the fortunes of america sep you are to decide the important question upon which rest the happiness and the liberty of millions yet unborn sep act worthy of yourselves sep well i believe we, the americans of today, are ready to act worthy of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to insure happiness and liberty for ourselves, our children, and our childrens children sep and as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen as having greater strength throughout the world sep we will again be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who do not now have
ENTJ	my friends: i want to talk for a few minutes with the people of the united states about banking -- to talk with the comparatively few who understand the mechanics of banking, but more particularly with the overwhelming majority of you who use banks for the making of deposits and the drawing of checks sep i want to tell you what has been done in the last few days, and why it was done, and what the next steps are going to be sep i recognize that the many proclamations from state capitols and from washington, the legislation, the treasury regulations, and so forth, couched for the most part in banking and legal terms, ought to be explained for the benefit of the average citizen sep i owe this, in particular, because of the fortitude and the good temper with which everybody has accepted the inconvenience and hardships of the banking holiday sep and i know that when you understand what we in washington have been about, i shall continue to have your cooperation as fully as i have had your sympathy and your help during the past week sep first of all, let me state the simple fact that when you deposit money in a bank, the bank does not put the money into a safe deposit vault sep it invests your money in many different forms of credit -- in bonds, in commercial paper, in mortgages and in many other kinds of loans sep in other words, the bank puts your money to work to keep the wheels of industry and of agriculture turning around sep a comparatively small part of the money that you put into the bank is kept in currency -- an amount which in normal times is wholly sufficient to cover the cash needs of the average citizen sep in other words, the total amount of all the currency in the country is only a comparatively small proportion of the total deposits in all the banks of the country sep what, then, happened during the last few days of february and the first few days of march sep because of undermined confidence on the part of the public, there was a general rush by a large portion of our population to turn bank deposits into currency or gold -- a rush so great that the soundest banks couldn't get enough currency to meet the demand sep the reason for this was that on the spur of the moment it was, of course, impossible to sell perfectly sound assets of a bank and convert them into cash, except at panic prices far below their real value sep by the afternoon of march third, a week ago last friday, scarcely a bank in the country was open to do business sep proclamations closing them, in whole or in part, had been issued by the governors in almost all the states sep it was then that i issued the proclamation providing for the national bank holiday, and this was the first step in the governments reconstruction of our financial and economic fabric sep the second step, last thursday, was the legislation promptly and patriotically passed by the congress confirming my proclamation and broadening my powers so that it became possible in view of the requirement of time to extend the holiday and lift the ban of that holiday gradually in the days to come sep this law also gave authority to develop a program of rehabilitation of our banking facilities sep and i want to tell our citizens in every part of the nation that the national congress -- republicans and democrats alike -- showed by this action a devotion to public welfare and a realization of the emergency and the necessity for speed that it is difficult to match in all our history sep the third stage has been the series of regulations permitting the banks to continue their functions to take care of the distribution of food and household necessities and the payment of payrolls sep this bank holiday, while resulting in many cases in great inconvenience, is affording us the opportunity to supply the currency necessary to meet the situation sep remember that no sound bank is a dollar worse off than it was when it closed its doors last week sep neither is any bank which may turn out not to be in a position for immediate opening sep the new law allows the twelve federal reserve banks to issue additional currency on good assets and thus the banks that reopen will be able to meet every legitimate call sep the new currency is being sent out by the bureau of engraving and printing in large volume to every part of the country sep it is sound currency because it is backed by actual, good assets sep another question you will ask is this: why are all the banks not to be reopened at the same time sep the answer is simple and i know you will understand it: your government does not intend that the history of the past few years shall be repeated sep we do not want and will not have another epidemic of bank failures sep as a result, we start tomorrow, monday, with the opening of banks in the twelve federal reserve bank cities -- those banks, which on first examination by the treasury, have already been found to be all right sep that will be followed on tuesday by the resumption of all other functions by banks already found to be sound in cities where there are recognized clearing houses sep that means about two hundred and fifty cities of the united states sep in other words, we are moving as fast as the mechanics of the situation will allow us sep on wednesday and succeeding days, banks in smaller places all through the country will resume business, subject, of course, to the government's physical ability to complete its survey it is necessary that the reopening of banks be extended over a period in order to permit the banks to make applications for the necessary loans, to obtain currency needed to meet their requirements, and to enable the government to make common sense checkups sep please let me make it clear to you that if your bank does not open the first day you are by no means justified in believing that it will not open sep a bank that opens on one of the subsequent days is in exactly the same status as the bank that opens tomorrow sep i know that many people are worrying about state banks that are not members of the federal reserve system sep there is no occasion for that worry sep these banks can and will receive assistance from member banks and from the reconstruction finance corporation sep and, of course, they are under the immediate control of the state banking authorities sep these state banks are following the same course as the national banks except that they get their licenses to resume business from the state authorities, and these authorities have been asked by the secretary of the treasury to permit their good banks to open up on the same schedule as the national banks sep and so i am confident that the state banking departments will be as careful as the national government in the policy relating to the opening of banks and will follow the same broad theory sep it is possible that when the banks resume a very few people who have not recovered from their fear may again begin withdrawals sep let me make it clear to you that the banks will take care of all needs, except, of course, the hysterical demands of hoarders, and it is my belief that hoarding during the past week has become an exceedingly unfashionable pastime in every part of our nation sep it needs no prophet to tell you that when the people find that they can get their money -- that they can get it when they want it for all legitimate purposes -- the phantom of fear will soon be laid sep people will again be glad to have their money where it will be safely taken care of and where they can use it conveniently at any time sep i can assure you, my friends, that it is safer to keep your money in a reopened bank than it is to keep it under the mattress sep the success of our whole national program depends, of course, on the cooperation of the public -- on its intelligent support and its use of a reliable system sep remember that the essential accomplishment of the new legislation is that it makes it possible for banks more readily to convert their assets into cash than was the case before sep more liberal provision has been made for banks to borrow on these assets at the reserve banks and more liberal provision has also been made for issuing currency on the security of these good assets sep this currency is not fiat currency sep it is issued only on adequate security, and every good bank has an abundance of such security sep one more point before i close sep there will be, of course, some banks unable to reopen without being reorganized sep the new law allows the government to assist in making these reorganizations quickly and effectively and even allows the government to subscribe to at least a part of any new capital that may be required sep i hope you can see, my friends, from this essential recital of what your government is doing that there is nothing complex, nothing radical in the process sep we have had a bad banking situation sep some of our bankers had shown themselves either incompetent or dishonest in their handling of the peoples funds sep they had used the money entrusted to them in speculations and unwise loans sep this was, of course, not true in the vast majority of our banks, but it was true in enough of them to shock the people of the united states, for a time, into a sense of insecurity and to put them into a frame of mind where they did not differentiate, but seemed to assume that the acts of a comparative few had tainted them all sep and so it became the governments job to straighten out this situation and do it as qu
ESTJ	mr sep president, mr sep speaker, members of the congress of the united states: the gravity of the situation which confronts the world today necessitates my appearance before a joint session of the congress sep the foreign policy and the national security of this country are involved sep one aspect of the present situation, which i present to you at this time for your consideration and decision, concerns greece and turkey sep the united states has received from the greek government an urgent appeal for financial and economic assistance sep preliminary reports from the american economic mission now in greece and reports from the american ambassador in greece corroborate the statement of the greek government that assistance is imperative if greece is to survive as a free nation sep i do not believe that the american people and the congress wish to turn a deaf ear to the appeal of the greek government sep greece is not a rich country sep lack of sufficient natural resources has always forced the greek people to work hard to make both ends meet sep since 1940, this industrious, peace loving country has suffered invasion, four years of cruel enemy occupation, and bitter internal strife sep when forces of liberation entered greece they found that the retreating germans had destroyed virtually all the railways, roads, port facilities, communications, and merchant marine sep more than a thousand villages had been burned sep eighty-five percent of the children were tubercular sep livestock, poultry, and draft animals had almost disappeared sep inflation had wiped out practically all savings sep as a result of these tragic conditions, a militant minority, exploiting human want and misery, was able to create political chaos which, until now, has made economic recovery impossible sep greece is today without funds to finance the importation of those goods which are essential to bare subsistence sep under these circumstances, the people of greece cannot make progress in solving their problems of reconstruction sep greece is in desperate need of financial and economic assistance to enable it to resume purchases of food, clothing, fuel, and seeds sep these are indispensable for the subsistence of its people and are obtainable only from abroad sep greece must have help to import the goods necessary to restore internal order and security, so essential for economic and political recovery sep the greek government has also asked for the assistance of experienced american administrators, economists, and technicians to insure that the financial and other aid given to greece shall be used effectively in creating a stable and self-sustaining economy and in improving its public administration sep the very existence of the greek state is today threatened by the terrorist activities of several thousand armed men, led by communists, who defy the government's authority at a number of points, particularly along the northern boundaries sep a commission appointed by the united nations security council is at present investigating disturbed conditions in northern greece and alleged border violations along the frontiers between greece on the one hand and albania, bulgaria, and yugoslavia on the other sep meanwhile, the greek government is unable to cope with the situation sep the greek army is small and poorly equipped sep it needs supplies and equipment if it is to restore authority of the government throughout greek territory sep greece must have assistance if it is to become a self-supporting and self-respecting democracy sep the united states must supply this assistance sep we have already extended to greece certain types of relief and economic aid sep but these are inadequate sep there is no other country to which democratic greece can turn sep no other nation is willing and able to provide the necessary support for a democratic greek government sep the british government, which has been helping greece, can give no further financial or economic aid after march 31st sep great britain finds itself under the necessity of reducing or liquidating its commitments in several parts of the world, including greece sep we have considered how the united nations might assist in this crisis sep but the situation is an urgent one, requiring immediate action, and the united nations and its related organizations are not in a position to extend help of the kind that is required sep it is important to note that the greek government has asked for our aid in utilizing effectively the financial and other assistance we may give to greece, and in improving its public administration sep it is of the utmost importance that we supervise the use of any funds made available to greece in such a manner that each dollar spent will count toward making greece self-supporting, and will help to build an economy in which a healthy democracy can flourish sep no government is perfect sep one of the chief virtues of a democracy, however, is that its defects are always visible and under democratic processes can be pointed out and corrected sep the government of greece is not perfect sep nevertheless it represents eighty-five percent of the members of the greek parliament who were chosen in an election last year sep foreign observers, including 692 americans, considered this election to be a fair expression of the views of the greek people sep the greek government has been operating in an atmosphere of chaos and extremism sep it has made mistakes sep the extension of aid by this country does not mean that the united states condones everything that the greek government has done or will do sep we have condemned in the past, and we condemn now, extremist measures of the right or the left sep we have in the past advised tolerance, and we advise tolerance now sep greek's [sic] neighbor, turkey, also deserves our attention sep the future of turkey, as an independent and economically sound state, is clearly no less important to the freedom-loving peoples of the world than the future of greece sep the circumstances in which turkey finds itself today are considerably different from those of greece sep turkey has been spared the disasters that have beset greece sep and during the war, the united states and great britain furnished turkey with material aid sep nevertheless, turkey now needs our support sep since the war, turkey has sought additional financial assistance from great britain and the united states for the purpose of effecting that modernization necessary for the maintenance of its national integrity sep that integrity is essential to the preservation of order in the middle east sep the british government has informed us that, owing to its own difficulties, it can no longer extend financial or economic aid to turkey sep as in the case of greece, if turkey is to have the assistance it needs, the united states must supply it sep we are the only country able to provide that help sep i am fully aware of the broad implications involved if the united states extends assistance to greece and turkey, and i shall discuss these implications with you at this time sep one of the primary objectives of the foreign policy of the united states is the creation of conditions in which we and other nations will be able to work out a way of life free from coercion sep this was a fundamental issue in the war with germany and japan sep our victory was won over countries which sought to impose their will, and their way of life, upon other nations sep to ensure the peaceful development of nations, free from coercion, the united states has taken a leading part in establishing the united nations sep the united nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members sep we shall not realize our objectives, however, unless we are willing to help free peoples to maintain their free institutions and their national integrity against aggressive movements that seek to impose upon them totalitarian regimes sep this is no more than a frank recognition that totalitarian regimes imposed upon free peoples, by direct or indirect aggression, undermine the foundations of international peace, and hence the security of the united states sep the peoples of a number of countries of the world have recently had totalitarian regimes forced upon them against their will sep the government of the united states has made frequent protests against coercion and intimidation in violation of the yalta agreement in poland, rumania, and bulgaria sep i must also state that in a number of other countries there have been similar developments sep at the present moment in world history nearly every nation must choose between alternative ways of life sep the choice is too often not a free one sep one way of life is based upon the will of the majority, and is distinguished by free institutions, representative government, free elections, guarantees of individual liberty, freedom of speech and religion, and freedom from political oppression sep the second way of life is based upon the will of a minority forcibly imposed upon the majority sep it relies upon terror and oppression, a controlled press and radio, fixed elections, and the suppression of personal freedoms sep i believe that it must be the policy of the united states to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures sep i believe that we must assist free peoples to work out their own destinies in their own way sep i believe that our help should be primarily through economic and financial aid which is essential to economic stability and orderly political processes sep the world is not static, and the status quo is not sacred sep but we cannot allow changes in the status quo in violation of the charter of the united nations by such methods as coercion, or by such subterfuges as political infiltration sep in helping free and independent nations to maintain their freedom, the united states will be giving effect to the principles of the charter of the united nations sep it is necessary only to glance at a map to realize that the survival and integrity of the greek nation are of grave importance in a much wider situation sep if greece should fall under the control of an armed minority, the effect upon its neighbor, turkey, would be immediate and serious sep confusion and disorder might well spread throughout the entire middle east sep moreover, the disappearance of greece as an independent state would have a profound effect upon those countries in europe whose peoples are struggling against great difficulties to maintain their freedoms and their independence while they repair the damages of war sep it would be an unspeakable tragedy if these countries, which have struggled so long against overwhelming odds, should lose that victory for which they sacrificed so much sep collapse of free institutions and loss of independence would be disastrous not only for them but for the world sep discouragement and possibly failure would quickly be the lot of neighboring peoples striving to maintain their freedom and independence sep should we fail to aid greece and turkey in this fateful hour, the effect will be far reaching to the west as well as to the east sep we must take immediate and resolute action sep i therefore ask the congress to provide authority for assistance to greece and turkey in the amount of $400,000,000 for the period ending june 30, 1948 sep in requesting these funds, i have taken into consideration the maximum amount of relief assistance which would be furnished to greece out of the $350,000,000 which i recently requested that the congress authorize for the prevention of starvation and suffering in countries devastated by the war sep in addition to funds, i ask the congress to authorize the detail of american civilian and military personnel to greece and turkey, at the request of those countries, to assist in the tasks of reconstruction, and for the purpose of supervising the use of such financial and material assistance as may be furnished sep i recommend that authority also be provided for the instruction and training of selected greek and turkish personnel sep finally, i ask that the congress provide authority which will permit the speediest and most effective use, in terms of needed commodities, supplies, and equipment, of such funds as may be authorized sep if further funds, or further authority, should be needed for the purposes indicated in this message, i shall not hesitate to bring the situation before the congress sep on this subject the executive and legislative branches of the government must work together sep this is a serious course upon which we embark sep i would not recommend it except that the alternative is much more serious sep the united states contributed $341,000,000,000 toward winning world war ii sep this is an investment in world freedom and world peace sep the assistance that i am recommending for greece and turkey amounts to little more than 1 tenth of 1 percent of this investment sep it is only common sense that we should safeguard this investment and make sure that it was not in vain sep the seeds of totalitarian regimes are nurtured by misery and want sep they spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife sep they reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died sep we must keep that hope alive sep the free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms sep if we falter in our leadership, we may endanger the peace of the world sep and we shall surely endanger the welfare of this nation sep great responsibilities have been placed upon us by the swift movement of events sep i am confident that the congress will face these responsibilities squarely
INFP	i feel that this award was not made to me as a man, but to my work -- a life's work in the agony and sweat of the human spirit, not for glory and least of all for profit, but to create out of the materials of the human spirit something which did not exist before sep so this award is only mine in trust sep it will not be difficult to find a dedication for the money part of it commensurate with the purpose and significance of its origin sep but i would like to do the same with the acclaim too, by using this moment as a pinnacle from which i might be listened to by the young men and women already dedicated to the same anguish and travail, among whom is already that one who will some day stand here where i am standing sep our tragedy today is a general and universal physical fear so long sustained by now that we can even bear it sep there are no longer problems of the spirit sep there is only the question: when will i be blown up sep because of this, the young man or woman writing today has forgotten the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat sep he must learn them again sep he must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed -- love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice sep until he does so, he labors under a curse sep he writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion sep his griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars sep he writes not of the heart but of the glands sep until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man sep i decline to accept the end of man sep it is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last ding-dong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking sep i refuse to accept this sep i believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail sep he is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance sep the poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things sep it is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past sep the poet's voice need not merely be the record of man, it can be one of the props, the pillars to help him endure and prevail
INFJ	your honor, years ago i recognized my kinship with all living beings, and i made up my mind that i was not one bit better than the meanest on earth sep i said then, and i say now, that while there is a lower class, i am in it, and while there is a criminal element i am of it, and while there is a soul in prison, i am not free sep i listened to all that was said in this court in support and justification of this prosecution, but my mind remains unchanged sep i look upon the espionage law as a despotic enactment in flagrant conflict with democratic principles and with the spirit of free institutions sep sep sep sep your honor, i have stated in this court that i am opposed to the social system in which we live; that i believe in a fundamental change -- but if possible by peaceable and orderly means sep sep sep sep standing here this morning, i recall my boyhood sep at fourteen i went to work in a railroad shop; at sixteen i was firing a freight engine on a railroad sep i remember all the hardships and privations of that earlier day, and from that time until now my heart has been with the working class sep i could have been in congress long ago sep i have preferred to go to prison sep sep sep sep i am thinking this morning of the men in the mills and the factories; of the men in the mines and on the railroads sep i am thinking of the women who for a paltry wage are compelled to work out their barren lives; of the little children who in this system are robbed of their childhood and in their tender years are seized in the remorseless grasp of mammon and forced into the industrial dungeons, there to feed the monster machines while they themselves are being starved and stunted, body and soul sep i see them dwarfed and diseased and their little lives broken and blasted because in this high noon of christian civilization money is still so much more important than the flesh and blood of childhood sep in very truth gold is god today and rules with pitiless sway in the affairs of men sep in this country -- the most favored beneath the bending skies -- we have vast areas of the richest and most fertile soil, material resources in inexhaustible abundance, the most marvelous productive machinery on earth, and millions of eager workers ready to apply their labor to that machinery to produce in abundance for every man, woman, and child -- and if there are still vast numbers of our people who are the victims of poverty and whose lives are an unceasing struggle all the way from youth to old age, until at last death comes to their rescue and lulls these hapless victims to dreamless sleep, it is not the fault of the almighty: it cannot be charged to nature, but it is due entirely to the outgrown social system in which we live that ought to be abolished not only in the interest of the toiling masses but in the higher interest of all humanity sep sep sep sep i believe, your honor, in common with all socialists, that this nation ought to own and control its own industries sep i believe, as all socialists do, that all things that are jointly needed and used ought to be jointly owned -- that industry, the basis of our social life, instead of being the private property of a few and operated for their enrichment, ought to be the common property of all, democratically administered in the interest of all sep sep sep sep i am opposing a social order in which it is possible for one man who does absolutely nothing that is useful to amass a fortune of hundreds of millions of dollars, while millions of men and women who work all the days of their lives secure barely enough for a wretched existence sep this order of things cannot always endure sep i have registered my protest against it sep i recognize the feebleness of my effort, but, fortunately, i am not alone sep there are multiplied thousands of others who, like myself, have come to realize that before we may truly enjoy the blessings of civilized life, we must reorganize society upon a mutual and cooperative basis; and to this end we have organized a great economic and political movement that spreads over the face of all the earth sep there are today upwards of sixty millions of socialists, loyal, devoted adherents to this cause, regardless of nationality, race, creed, color, or sex sep they are all making common cause sep they are spreading with tireless energy the propaganda of the new social order sep they are waiting, watching, and working hopefully through all the hours of the day and the night sep they are still in a minority sep but they have learned how to be patient and to bide their time sep they feel -- they know, indeed -- that the time is coming, in spite of all opposition, all persecution, when this emancipating gospel will spread among all the peoples, and when this minority will become the triumphant majority and, sweeping into power, inaugurate the greatest social and economic change in history sep in that day we shall have the universal commonwealth -- the harmonious cooperation of every nation with every other nation on earth sep sep sep sep your honor, i ask no mercy and i plead for no immunity sep i realize that finally the right must prevail sep i never so clearly comprehended as now the great struggle between the powers of greed and exploitation on the one hand and upon the other the rising hosts of industrial freedom and social justice sep i can see the dawn of the better day for humanity sep the people are awakening sep in due time they will and must come to their own sep when the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eyes toward the southern cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean sep as the midnight approaches, the southern cross begins to bend, the whirling worlds change their places, and with starry fingerpoints the almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may beat the glad tidings, the lookout knows that the midnight is passing and that relief and rest are close at hand sep let the people everywhere take heart of hope, for the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning sep i am now prepared to receive your sentence
ESTJ	thank you very much, gertrude mongella, for your dedicated work that has brought us to this point, distinguished delegates, and guests: i would like to thank the secretary general for inviting me to be part of this important united nations fourth world conference on women sep this is truly a celebration, a celebration of the contributions women make in every aspect of life: in the home, on the job, in the community, as mothers, wives, sisters, daughters, learners, workers, citizens, and leaders sep it is also a coming together, much the way women come together every day in every country sep we come together in fields and factories, in village markets and supermarkets, in living rooms and board rooms sep whether it is while playing with our children in the park, or washing clothes in a river, or taking a break at the office water cooler, we come together and talk about our aspirations and concern sep and time and again, our talk turns to our children and our families sep however different we may appear, there is far more that unites us than divides us sep we share a common future, and we are here to find common ground so that we may help bring new dignity and respect to women and girls all over the world, and in so doing bring new strength and stability to families as well sep by gathering in beijing, we are focusing world attention on issues that matter most in our lives -- the lives of women and their families: access to education, health care, jobs and credit, the chance to enjoy basic legal and human rights and to participate fully in the political life of our countries sep there are some who question the reason for this conference sep let them listen to the voices of women in their homes, neighborhoods, and workplaces sep there are some who wonder whether the lives of women and girls matter to economic and political progress around the globe sep let them look at the women gathered here and at huairou -- the homemakers and nurses, the teachers and lawyers, the policymakers and women who run their own businesses sep it is conferences like this that compel governments and peoples everywhere to listen, look, and face the worlds most pressing problems sep wasnt it after all -- after the womens conference in nairobi ten years ago that the world focused for the first time on the crisis of domestic violence sep earlier today, i participated in a world health organization forum sep in that forum, we talked about ways that government officials, ngos, and individual citizens are working to address the health problems of women and girls sep tomorrow, i will attend a gathering of the united nations development fund for women sep there, the discussion will focus on local -- and highly successful -- programs that give hard-working women access to credit so they can improve their own lives and the lives of their families sep what we are learning around the world is that if women are healthy and educated, their families will flourish sep if women are free from violence, their families will flourish sep if women have a chance to work and earn as full and equal partners in society, their families will flourish sep and when families flourish, communities and nations do as well sep that is why every woman, every man, every child, every family, and every nation on this planet does have a stake in the discussion that takes place here sep over the past 25 years, i have worked persistently on issues relating to women, children, and families sep over the past two and a half years, i've had the opportunity to learn more about the challenges facing women in my own country and around the world sep i have met new mothers in indonesia, who come together regularly in their village to discuss nutrition, family planning, and baby care sep i have met working parents in denmark who talk about the comfort they feel in knowing that their children can be cared for in safe, and nurturing after-school centers sep i have met women in south africa who helped lead the struggle to end apartheid and are now helping to build a new democracy sep i have met with the leading women of my own hemisphere who are working every day to promote literacy and better health care for children in their countries sep i have met women in india and bangladesh who are taking out small loans to buy milk cows, or rickshaws, or thread in order to create a livelihood for themselves and their families sep i have met the doctors and nurses in belarus and ukraine who are trying to keep children alive in the aftermath of chernobyl sep the great challenge of this conference is to give voice to women everywhere whose experiences go unnoticed, whose words go unheard sep women comprise more than half the worlds population, 70% of the worlds poor, and two-thirds of those who are not taught to read and write sep we are the primary caretakers for most of the worlds children and elderly sep yet much of the work we do is not valued -- not by economists, not by historians, not by popular culture, not by government leaders sep at this very moment, as we sit here, women around the world are giving birth, raising children, cooking meals, washing clothes, cleaning houses, planting crops, working on assembly lines, running companies, and running countries sep women also are dying from diseases that should have been prevented or treated sep they are watching their children succumb to malnutrition caused by poverty and economic deprivation sep they are being denied the right to go to school by their own fathers and brothers sep they are being forced into prostitution, and they are being barred from the bank lending offices and banned from the ballot box sep those of us who have the opportunity to be here have the responsibility to speak for those who could not sep as an american, i want to speak for those women in my own country, women who are raising children on the minimum wage, women who cant afford health care or child care, women whose lives are threatened by violence, including violence in their own homes sep i want to speak up for mothers who are fighting for good schools, safe neighborhoods, clean air, and clean airwaves; for older women, some of them widows, who find that, after raising their families, their skills and life experiences are not valued in the marketplace; for women who are working all night as nurses, hotel clerks, or fast food chefs so that they can be at home during the day with their children; and for women everywhere who simply dont have time to do everything they are called upon to do each and every day sep speaking to you today, i speak for them, just as each of us speaks for women around the world who are denied the chance to go to school, or see a doctor, or own property, or have a say about the direction of their lives, simply because they are women sep the truth is that most women around the world work both inside and outside the home, usually by necessity sep we need to understand there is no one formula for how women should lead our lives sep that is why we must respect the choices that each woman makes for herself and her family sep every woman deserves the chance to realize her own god-given potential sep but we must recognize that women will never gain full dignity until their human rights are respected and protected sep our goals for this conference, to strengthen families and societies by empowering women to take greater control over their own destinies, cannot be fully achieved unless all governments -- here and around the world -- accept their responsibility to protect and promote internationally recognized human rights sep the -- the international community has long acknowledged and recently reaffirmed at vienna that both women and men are entitled to a range of protections and personal freedoms, from the right of personal security to the right to determine freely the number and spacing of the children they bear sep no one -- no one should be forced to remain silent for fear of religious or political persecution, arrest, abuse, or torture sep tragically, women are most often the ones whose human rights are violated sep even now, in the late 20th century, the rape of women continues to be used as an instrument of armed conflict sep women and children make up a large majority of the worlds refugees sep and when women are excluded from the political process, they become even more vulnerable to abuse sep i believe that now, on the eve of a new millennium, it is time to break the silence sep it is time for us to say here in beijing, and for the world to hear, that it is no longer acceptable to discuss womens rights as separate from human rights sep these abuses have continued because, for too long, the history of women has been a history of silence sep even today, there are those who are trying to silence our words sep but the voices of this conference and of the women at huairou must be heard loudly and clearly: it is a violation of human rights when babies are denied food, or drowned, or suffocated, or their spines broken, simply because they are born girls sep it is a violation of human rights when women and girls are sold into the slavery of prostitution for human greed -- and the kinds of reasons that are used to justify this practice should no longer be tolerated sep it is a violation of human rights when women are doused with gasoline, set on fire, and burned to death because their marriage dowries are deemed too small sep it is a violation of human rights when individual women are raped in their own communities and when thousands of women are subjected to rape as a tactic or prize of war sep it is a violation of human rights when a leading cause of death worldwide among women ages 14 to 44 is the violence they are subjected to in their own homes by their own relatives sep it is a violation of human rights when young girls are brutalized by the painful and degrading practice of genital mutilation sep it is a violation of human rights when women are denied the right to plan their own families, and that includes being forced to have abortions or being sterilized against their will sep if there is one message that echoes forth from this conference, let it be that human rights are womens rights and womens rights are human rights once and for all sep 1 let us not forget that among those rights are the right to speak freely -
ISTJ	madam president, members of the general assembly: when secretary general hammarskjolds invitation to address this general assembly reached me in bermuda, i was just beginning a series of conferences with the prime ministers and foreign ministers of great britain and of france sep our subject was some of the problems that beset our world sep during the remainder of the bermuda conference, i had constantly in mind that ahead of me lay a great honor sep that honor is mine today, as i stand here, privileged to address the general assembly of the united nations sep at the same time that i appreciate the distinction of addressing you, i have a sense of exhilaration as i look upon this assembly sep never before in history has so much hope for so many people been gathered together in a single organization sep your deliberations and decisions during these somber years have already realized part of those hopes sep but the great tests and the great accomplishments still lie ahead sep and in the confident expectation of those accomplishments, i would use the office which, for the time being, i hold, to assure you that the government of the united states will remain steadfast in its support of this body sep this we shall do in the conviction that you will provide a great share of the wisdom, of the courage, and the faith which can bring to this world lasting peace for all nations, and happiness and well-being for all men sep clearly, it would not be fitting for me to take this occasion to present to you a unilateral american report on bermuda sep nevertheless, i assure you that in our deliberations on that lovely island we sought to invoke those same great concepts of universal peace and human dignity which are so cleanly etched in your charter sep neither would it be a measure of this great opportunity merely to recite, however hopefully, pious platitudes sep i therefore decided that this occasion warranted my saying to you some of the things that have been on the minds and hearts of my legislative and executive associates, and on mine, for a great many months -- thoughts i had originally planned to say primarily to the american people sep i know that the american people share my deep belief that if a danger exists in the world, it is a danger shared by all; and equally, that if hope exists in the mind of one nation, that hope should be shared by all sep finally, if there is to be advanced any proposal designed to ease even by the smallest measure the tensions of todays world, what more appropriate audience could there be than the members of the general assembly of the united nations sep i feel impelled to speak today in a language that in a sense is new, one which i, who have spent so much of my life in the military profession, would have preferred never to use sep that new language is the language of atomic warfare sep the atomic age has moved forward at such a pace that every citizen of the world should have some comprehension, at least in comparative terms, of the extent of this development, of the utmost significance to everyone of us sep clearly, if the peoples of the world are to conduct an intelligent search for peace, they must be armed with the significant facts of todays existence sep my recital of atomic danger and power is necessarily stated in united states terms, for these are the only incontrovertible facts that i know sep i need hardly point out to this assembly, however, that this subject is global, not merely national in character sep on july 16, 1945, the united states set off the worlds first atomic explosion sep since that date in 1945, the united states of america has conducted forty-two test explosions sep atomic bombs today are more than twenty-five times as powerful as the weapons with which the atomic age dawned, while hydrogen weapons are in the ranges of millions of tons of tnt equivalent sep today, the united states stockpile of atomic weapons, which, of course, increases daily, exceeds by many times the total [explosive] equivalent of the total of all bombs and all shells that came from every plane and every gun in every theatre of war in all the years of world war ii sep a single air group, whether afloat or land based, can now deliver to any reachable target a destructive cargo exceeding in power all the bombs that fell on britain in all of world war ii sep in size and variety, the development of atomic weapons has been no less remarkable sep the development has been such that atomic weapons have virtually achieved conventional status within our armed services sep in the united states, the army, the navy, the air force, and the marine corps are all capable of putting this weapon to military use sep but the dread secret and the fearful engines of atomic might are not ours alone sep in the first place, the secret is possessed by our friends and allies, great britain and canada, whose scientific genius made a tremendous contribution to our original discoveries and the designs of atomic bombs sep the secret is also known by the soviet union sep the soviet union has informed us that, over recent years, it has devoted extensive resources to atomic weapons sep during this period the soviet union has exploded a series of atomic advices -- devices, including at least one involving thermo-nuclear reactions sep if at one time the unites states possessed what might have been called a monopoly of atomic power, that monopoly ceased to exist several years ago sep therefore, although our earlier start has permitted us to accumulate what is today a great quantitative advantage, the atomic realities of today comprehend two facts of even greater significance sep first, the knowledge now possessed by several nations will eventually be shared by others, possibly all others sep second, even a vast superiority in numbers of weapons, and a consequent capability of devastating retaliation, is no preventive, of itself, against the fearful material damage and toll of human lives that would be inflicted by surprise aggression sep the free world, at least dimly aware of these facts, has naturally embarked on a large program of warning and defense systems sep that program will be accelerated and expanded sep but let no one think that the expenditure of vast sums for weapons and systems of defense can guarantee absolute safety for the cities and citizens of any nation sep the awful arithmetic of the atomic bomb does not permit of any such easy solution sep even against the most powerful defense, an aggressor in possession of the effective minimum number of atomic bombs for a surprise attack could probably place a sufficient number of his bombs on the chosen targets to cause hideous damage sep should such an atomic attack be launched against the united states, our reactions would be swift and resolute sep but for me to say that the defense capabilities of the united states are such that they could inflict terrible losses upon an aggressor, for me to say that the retaliation capabilities of the unites states are so great that such an aggressors land would be laid waste, all this, while fact, is not the true expression of the purpose and the hope of the united states sep to pause there would be to confirm the hopeless finality of a belief that two atomic colossi are doomed malevolently to eye each other indefinitely across a trembling world sep to stop there would be to accept hope -- helplessly the probability of civilization destroyed, the annihilation of the irreplaceable heritage of mankind handed down to use generation from generation, and the condemnation of mankind to begin all over again the age-old struggle upward from savagery toward decency, and right, and justice sep surely no sane member of the human race could discover victory in such desolation sep could anyone wish his name to be coupled by history with such human degradation and destruction sep occasional pages of history do record the faces of the great destroyers, but the whole book of history reveals mankinds never-ending quest for peace and mankinds god-given capacity to build sep it is with the book of history, and not with isolated pages, that the united states will ever wish to be identified sep my country wants to be constructive, not destructive sep it wants agreements, not wars, among nations sep it wants itself to live in freedom and in the confidence that the people of every other nation enjoy equally the right of choosing their own way of life sep so my countrys purpose is to help us move out of the dark chamber of horrors into the light, to find a way by which the minds of men, the hopes of men, the souls of men everywhere, can move forward toward peace and happiness and well-being sep in this quest, i know that we must not lack patience sep i know that in a world divided, such as ours today, salvation cannot be attained by one dramatic act sep i know that many steps will have to be taken over many months before the world can look at itself one day and truly realize that a new climate of mutually peaceful confidence is abroad in the world sep but i know, above all else, that we must start to take these steps now sep the united states and its allies, great britain and france, have, over the past months, tried to take some of these steps sep let no one say that we shun the conference table sep on the record has long stood the request of the united states, great britain, and france to negotiate with the soviet union the problems of a divided germany sep on that record has long stood the request of the same three nations to negotiate an austrian peace treaty sep on the same record still stands the request of the united nations to negotiate the problems of korea sep most recently we have received from the soviet union what is in effect an expression of willingness to hold a four-power meeting sep along with our allies, great britain and france, we were pleased to see that his note did not contain the unacceptable pre-conditions previously put forward sep as you already know from our joint bermuda communiqu sep , the united states, great britain, and france have agreed promptly to meet with the soviet union sep the government of the united states approaches this conference with hopeful sincerity sep we will bend every effort of our minds to the single purpose of emerging from that conference with tangible results towards peace, the only true way of lessening international tension sep we never have, we never will, propose or suggest that the soviet union surrender what is rightfully theirs sep we will never say that the people of russia are an enemy with whom we have no desire ever to deal or mingle in friendly and fruitful relationship sep on the contrary, we hope that this coming conference may initiate a relationship with the soviet union which will eventually bring about a free intermingling of the peoples of the east and of the west -- the one sure, human way of developing the understanding required for confident and peaceful relations sep instead of the discontent which is now settling upon eastern germany, occupied austria, and the countries of eastern europe, we seek a harmonious family of free european nations, with none a threat to the other, and least of all a threat to the peoples of the russia sep beyond the turmoil and strife and misery of asia, we seek peaceful opportunity for these peoples to develop their natural resources and to elevate their lives sep these are not idle words or shallow visions sep behind them lies a story of nations lately come to independence, not as a result of war, but through free grant or peaceful negotiation sep there is a record already written of assistance gladly given by nations of the west to needy peoples and to those suffering the temporary effects of famine, drought, and natural disaster sep these are deeds of peace sep they speak more loudly than promises or protestations of peaceful intent sep but i do not wish to rest either upon the reiteration of past proposals or the restatement of past deeds sep the gravity of the time is such that every new avenue of peace, no matter how dimly discernible, should be explored sep there is at least one new avenue of peace which has not yet been well explored -- an avenue now laid out by the general assembly of the unites nations sep in its resolution of november 18th, 1953 this general assembly suggested -- and i quote -- that the disarmament commission study the desirability of establishing a sub-committee consisting of representatives of the powers principally involved, which should seek in private an acceptable solution and report such a solution to the general assembly and to the security council not later than september 1, of 1954 sep the united states, heeding the suggestion of the general assembly of the united nations, is instantly prepared to meet privately with such other countries as may be principally involved, to seek an acceptable solution to the atomic armaments race which overshadows not only the peace, but the very life of the world sep we shall carry into these private or diplomatic talks a new conception sep the united states would seek more than the mere reduction or elimination of atomic materials for military purposes sep it is not enough to take this weapon out of the hands of the soldiers sep it must be put into the hands of those who will know how to strip its military casing and adapt it to the arts of peace sep the united states knows that if the fearful trend of atomic military build-up can be reversed, this greatest of destructive forces can be developed into a great boon, for the benefit of all mankind sep the united states knows that peaceful power from atomic energy is no dream of the future sep that capability, already proved, is here, now, today sep who can doubt, if the entire body of the worlds scientists and engineers had adequate amounts of fissionable material with which to test and develop their ideas, that this capability would rapidly be transformed into universal, efficient, and economic usage sep to hasten the day when fear of the atom will begin to disappear from the minds of people and the governments o
ESFP	president anderson, members of the faculty, board of trustees, distinguished guests, my old colleague, senator bob byrd, who has earned his degree through many years of attending night law school, while i am earning mine in the next 30 minutes, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen: it is with great pride that i participate in this ceremony of the american university, sponsored by the methodist church, founded by bishop john fletcher hurst, and first opened by president woodrow wilson in 1914 sep this is a young and growing university, but it has already fulfilled bishop hurst's enlightened hope for the study of history and public affairs in a city devoted to the making of history and to the conduct of the public's business sep by sponsoring this institution of higher learning for all who wish to learn, whatever their color or their creed, the methodists of this area and the nation deserve the nation's thanks, and i commend all those who are today graduating sep professor woodrow wilson once said that every man sent out from a university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time, and i am confident that the men and women who carry the honor of graduating from this institution will continue to give from their lives, from their talents, a high measure of public service and public support sep "there are few earthly things more beautiful than a university," wrote john masefield in his tribute to english universities -- and his words are equally true today sep he did not refer to towers or to campuses sep he admired the splendid beauty of a university, because it was, he said, "a place where those who hate ignorance may strive to know, where those who perceive truth may strive to make others see sep "i have, therefore, chosen this time and place to discuss a topic on which ignorance too often abounds and the truth too rarely perceived sep and that is the most important topic on earth: peace sep what kind of peace do i mean and what kind of a peace do we seek sep not a pax americana enforced on the world by american weapons of war sep not the peace of the grave or the security of the slave sep i am talking about genuine peace, the kind of peace that makes life on earth worth living, and the kind that enables men and nations to grow, and to hope, and build a better life for their children -- not merely peace for americans but peace for all men and women, not merely peace in our time but peace in all time sep i speak of peace because of the new face of war sep total war makes no sense in an age where great powers can maintain large and relatively invulnerable nuclear forces and refuse to surrender without resort to those forces sep it makes no sense in an age where a single nuclear weapon contains almost ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied air forces in the second world war sep it makes no sense in an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and water and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn sep today the expenditure of billions of dollars every year on weapons acquired for the purpose of making sure we never need them is essential to the keeping of peace sep but surely the acquisition of such idle stockpiles -- which can only destroy and never create -- is not the only, much less the most efficient, means of assuring peace sep i speak of peace, therefore, as the necessary, rational end of rational men sep i realize the pursuit of peace is not as dramatic as the pursuit of war, and frequently the words of the pursuers fall on deaf ears sep but we have no more urgent task sep some say that it is useless to speak of peace or world law or world disarmament, and that it will be useless until the leaders of the soviet union adopt a more enlightened attitude sep i hope they do sep i believe we can help them do it sep but i also believe that we must reexamine our own attitudes, as individuals and as a nation, for our attitude is as essential as theirs sep and every graduate of this school, every thoughtful citizen who despairs of war and wishes to bring peace, should begin by looking inward, by examining his own attitude towards the possibilities of peace, towards the soviet union, towards the course of the cold war and towards freedom and peace here at home sep first examine our attitude towards peace itself sep too many of us think it is impossible sep too many think it is unreal sep but that is a dangerous, defeatist belief sep it leads to the conclusion that war is inevitable, that mankind is doomed, that we are gripped by forces we cannot control sep we need not accept that view sep our problems are manmade; therefore, they can be solved by man sep and man can be as big as he wants sep no problem of human destiny is beyond human beings sep man's reason and spirit have often solved the seemingly unsolvable, and we believe they can do it again sep i am not referring to the absolute, infinite concept of universal peace and good will of which some fantasies and fanatics dream sep i do not deny the value of hopes and dreams but we merely invite discouragement and incredulity by making that our only and immediate goal sep let us focus instead on a more practical, more attainable peace, based not on a sudden revolution in human nature but on a gradual evolution in human institutions -- on a series of concrete actions and effective agreements which are in the interest of all concerned sep there is no single, simple key to this peace; no grand or magic formula to be adopted by one or two powers sep genuine peace must be the product of many nations, the sum of many acts sep it must be dynamic, not static, changing to meet the challenge of each new generation sep for peace is a process -- a way of solving problems sep with such a peace, there will still be quarrels and conflicting interests, as there are within families and nations sep world peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor, it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement sep and history teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever sep however fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors sep so let us persevere sep peace need not be impracticable, and war need not be inevitable sep by defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all people to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly towards it sep and second, let us reexamine our attitude towards the soviet union sep it is discouraging to think that their leaders may actually believe what their propagandists write sep it is discouraging to read a recent, authoritative soviet text on military strategy and find, on page after page, wholly baseless and incredible claims, such as the allegation that american imperialist circles are preparing to unleash different types of war, that there is a very real threat of a preventive war being unleashed by american imperialists against the soviet union, and that the political aims -- and i quote -- "of the american imperialists are to enslave economically and politically the european and other capitalist countries and to achieve world domination by means of aggressive war sep "truly, as it was written long ago: "the wicked flee when no man pursueth sep "yet it is sad to read these soviet statements, to realize the extent of the gulf between us sep but it is also a warning, a warning to the american people not to fall into the same trap as the soviets, not to see only a distorted and desperate view of the other side, not to see conflict as inevitable, accommodation as impossible, and communication as nothing more than an exchange of threats sep no government or social system is so evil that its people must be considered as lacking in virtue sep as americans, we find communism profoundly repugnant as a negation of personal freedom and dignity sep but we can still hail the russian people for their many achievements in science and space, in economic and industrial growth, in culture, in acts of courage sep among the many traits the peoples of our two countries have in common, none is stronger than our mutual abhorrence of war sep almost unique among the major world powers, we have never been at war with each other sep and no nation in the history of battle ever suffered more than the soviet union in the second world war sep at least 20 million lost their lives sep countless millions of homes and families were burned or sacked sep a third of the nation's territory, including two thirds of its industrial base, was turned into a wasteland -- a loss equivalent to the destruction of this country east of chicago sep today, should total war ever break out again -- no matter how -- our two countries will be the primary target sep it is an ironic but accurate fact that the two strongest powers are the two in the most danger of devastation sep all we have built, all we have worked for, would be destroyed in the first 24 hours sep and even in the cold war, which brings burdens and dangers to so many countries, including this nation's closest allies, our two countries bear the heaviest burdens sep for we are both devoting massive sums of money to weapons that could be better devoted to combat ignorance, poverty, and disease sep we are both caught up in a vicious and dangerous cycle, with suspicion on one side breeding suspicion on the other, and new weapons begetting counter-weapons sep in short, both the united states and its allies, and the soviet union and its allies, have a mutually deep interest in a just and genuine peace and in halting the arms race sep agreements to this end are in the interests of the soviet union as well as ours sep and even the most hostile nations can be relied upon to accept and keep those treaty obligations, and only those treaty obligations, which are in their own interest sep so let us not be blind to our differences, but let us also direct attention to our common interests and the means by which those differences can be resolved sep and if we cannot end now our differences, at least we can help make the world safe for diversity sep for in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet sep we all breathe the same air sep we all cherish our children's futures sep and we are all mortal sep third, let us reexamine our attitude towards the cold war, remembering we're not engaged in a debate, seeking to pile up debating points sep we are not here distributing blame or pointing the finger of judgment sep we must deal with the world as it is, and not as it might have been had the history of the last 18 years been different sep we must, therefore, persevere in the search for peace in the hope that constructive changes within the communist bloc might bring within reach solutions which now seem beyond us sep we must conduct our affairs in such a way that it becomes in the communists' interest to agree on a genuine peace sep and above all, while defending our own vital interests, nuclear powers must avert those confrontations which bring an adversary to a choice of either a humiliating retreat or a nuclear war sep to adopt that kind of course in the nuclear age would be evidence only of the bankruptcy of our policy -- or of a collective death-wish for the world sep to secure these ends, america's weapons are nonprovocative, carefully controlled, designed to deter, and capable of selective use sep our military forces are committed to peace and disciplined in self-restraint sep our diplomats are instructed to avoid unnecessary irritants and purely rhetorical hostility sep for we can seek a relaxation of tensions without relaxing our guard sep and, for our part, we do not need to use threats to prove we are resolute sep we do not need to jam foreign broadcasts out of fear our faith will be eroded sep we are unwilling to impose our system on any unwilling people, but we are willing and able to engage in peaceful competition with any people on earth sep meanwhile, we seek to strengthen the united nations, to help solve its financial problems, to make it a more effective instrument for peace, to develop it into a genuine world security system -- a system capable of resolving disputes on the basis of law, of insuring the security of the large and the small, and of creating conditions under which arms can finally be abolished sep at the same time we seek to keep peace inside the non-communist world, where many nations, all of them our friends, are divided over issues which weaken western unity, which invite communist intervention, or which threaten to erupt into war sep our efforts in west new guinea, in the congo, in the middle east, and the indian subcontinent, have been persistent and patient despite criticism from both sides sep we have also tried to set an example for others, by seeking to adjust small but significant differences with our own closest neighbors in mexico and canada sep speaking of other nations, i wish to make one point clear sep we are bound to many nations by alliances sep those alliances exist because our concern and theirs substantially overlap sep our commitment to defend western europe and west berlin, for example, stands undiminished because of the identity of our vital interests sep the united states will make no deal with the soviet union at the expense of other nations and other peoples, not merely because they are our partners, but also because their interests and ours converge sep our interests converge, however, not only in defending the frontiers of freedom, but in pursuing the paths of peace sep it is our hope, and the purpose of allied policy, to convince the soviet union that she, too, should let each nation choose its own future, so long as that choice does not interfere with the choices of others sep the communist drive to impose their political and economic system on others is the primary cause of world tension today sep for there can be no doubt that if all nations could refrain from interfering in the self-determination of others, the peace would be much more assured sep this will require a new effort to achieve world law, a new context for world discussions sep it will require increased understanding between the soviets and ourselves sep and increased understanding will require increased contact and communication sep one step in this direction is the proposed arrangement for a direct line between moscow and washington, to avoid on each side the dangerous delays, misunderstandings, and misreadings of others' actions which might occur at a time of crisis sep we have also been talking in geneva about our first-step measures of arm[s] controls designed to limit the intensity of the arms race and reduce the risk of accidental war sep our primary long range interest in geneva, however, is general and complete disarmament, designed to take place by stages, permitting parallel political developments to build the new institutions of peace which would take the place of arms sep the pursuit of disarmament has been an effort of this government since the 1920's sep it has been urgently sought by the past three administrations sep and however dim the prospects are today, we intend to continue this effort -- to continue it in order that all countries, including our own, can better grasp what the problems and possibilities of disarmament are sep the only major area of these negotiations where the end is in sight, yet where a fresh start is badly needed, is in a treaty to outlaw nuclear tests sep the conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas sep it would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms sep it would increase our security; it would decrease the prospects of war sep surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards sep i'm taking this opportunity, therefore, to announce two important decisions in this regard sep first, chairman khrushchev, prime minister macmillan, and i have agreed that high-level discussions will shortly begin in moscow looking towards early agreement on a comprehensive test ban treaty sep our hope must be tempered -- our hopes must be tempered with the caution of history; but with our hopes go the hopes of all mankind sep second, to make clear our good faith and solemn convictions on this matter, i now declare that the united states does not propose to conduct nuclear tests in the atmosphere so long as other states do not do so sep we will not -- we will not be the first to resume sep such a declaration is no substitute for a formal binding treaty, but i hope it will help us achieve one sep nor would such a treaty be a substitute for disarmament, but i hope it will help us achieve it sep finally, my fellow americans, let us examine our attitude towards peace and freedom here at home sep the quality and spirit of our own society must justify and support our efforts abroad sep we must show it in the dedication of our own lives -- as many of you who are graduating today will have an opportunity to do, by serving without pay in the peace corps abroad or in the proposed national service corps here at home sep but wherever we are, we must all, in our daily lives, live up to the age-old faith that peace and freedom walk together sep in too many of our cities today, the peace is not secure because freedom is incomplete sep it is the responsibility of the executive branch at all levels of government -- local, state, and national -- to provide and protect that freedom for all of our citizens by all means within our authority sep it is the responsibility of the legislative branch at all levels, wherever the authority is not now adequate, to make it adequate sep and it is the responsibility of all citizens in all sections of this country to respect the rights of others and respect the law of the land sep all this -- all this is not unrelated to world peace sep "when a man's way[s] please the lord," the scriptures tell us, "he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him sep " and is not peace, in the last analysis, basically a matter of human rights: the right to live out our lives without fear of devastation; the right to breathe air as nature provided it; the right of future generations to a healthy existence sep while we proceed to safeguard our national interests, let us also safeguard human interests sep and the elimination of war and arms is clearly in the interest of both sep no treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of all, however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security against the risks of deception and evasion sep but it can, if it is sufficiently effective in its enforcement, and it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers, offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race sep the united states, as the world knows, will never start a war sep we do not want a war sep we do not now expect a war sep this generation of americans has already had enough -- more than enough -- of war and hate and oppression sep we shall be prepared if others wish it sep we shall be alert to try to stop it sep but we shall also do our part to build a world of peace where the weak are safe and the strong are just sep we are not helpless before that task or hopeless of its success sep confident and unafraid, we must labor on -- not towards a strategy of annihilation but towards a strategy of peace
ISTJ	good evening sep this is the 37th time i have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shape the history of this nation sep each time i have done so to discuss with you some matter that i believe affected the national interest sep in all the decisions i have made in my public life i have always tried to do what was best for the nation sep throughout the long and difficult period of watergate, i have felt it was my duty to persevere -- to make every possible effort to complete the term of office to which you elected me sep in the past few days, however, it has become evident to me that i no longer have a strong enough political base in the congress to justify continuing that effort sep as long as there was such a base, i felt strongly that it was necessary to see the constitutional process through to its conclusion; that to do otherwise would be unfaithful to the spirit of that deliberately difficult process, and a dangerously destabilizing precedent for the future sep but with the disappearance of that base, i now believe that the constitutional purpose has been served sep and there is no longer a need for the process to be prolonged sep i would have preferred to carry through to the finish whatever the personal agony it would have involved, and my family unanimously urged me to do so sep but the interests of the nation must always come before any personal considerations sep from the discussions i have had with congressional and other leaders i have concluded that because of the watergate matter i might not have the support of the congress that i would consider necessary to back the very difficult decisions and carry out the duties of this office in the way the interests of the nation will require sep i have never been a quitter sep to leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body sep but as president, i must put the interests of america first sep america needs a full-time president and a full-time congress, particularly at this time with problems we face at home and abroad sep to continue to fight through the months ahead for my personal vindication would almost totally absorb the time and attention of both the president and the congress in a period when our entire focus should be on the great issues of peace abroad and prosperity without inflation at home sep therefore, i shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow sep vice president ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office sep as i recall the high hopes for america with which we began this second term, i feel a great sadness that i will not be here in this office working on your behalf to achieve those hopes in the next two and a half years sep but in turning over direction of the government to vice president ford i know, as i told the nation when i nominated him for that office ten months ago, that the leadership of america would be in good hands sep in passing this office to the vice president, i also do so with the profound sense of the weight of responsibility that will fall on his shoulders tomorrow, and therefore of the understanding, the patience, the cooperation he will need from all americans sep as he assumes that responsibility he will deserve the help and the support of all of us sep as we look to the future, the first essential is to begin healing the wounds of this nation sep to put the bitterness and divisions of the recent past behind us and to rediscover those shared ideals that lie at the heart of our strength and unity as a great and as a free people sep by taking this action, i hope that i will have hastened the start of that process of healing which is so desperately needed in america sep i regret deeply any injuries that may have been done in the course of the events that led to this decision sep i would say only that if some of my judgments were wrong -- and some were wrong -- they were made in what i believed at the time to be the best interests of the nation sep to those who have stood with me during these past difficult months, to my family, my friends, the many others who joined in supporting my cause because they believed it was right, i will be eternally grateful for your support sep and to those who have not felt able to give me your support, let me say i leave with no bitterness toward those who have opposed me, because all of us in the final analysis have been concerned with the good of the country, however our judgments might differ sep so let us all now join together in affirming that common commitment and in helping our new president succeed for the benefit of all americans sep i shall leave this office with regret at not completing my term but with gratitude for the privilege of serving as your president for the past five and a half years sep these years have been a momentous time in the history of our nation and the world sep they have been a time of achievement in which we can all be proud, achievements that represent the shared efforts of the administration, the congress and the people sep but the challenges ahead are equally great sep and they, too, will require the support and the efforts of the congress and the people, working in cooperation with the new administration sep we have ended america's longest war sep but in the work of securing a lasting peace in the world, the goals ahead are even more far-reaching and more difficult sep we must complete a structure of peace, so that it will be said of this generation -- our generation of americans -- by the people of all nations, not only that we ended one war but that we prevented future wars sep we have unlocked the doors that for a quarter of a century stood between the united states and the people's republic of china sep we must now insure that the one-quarter of the world's people who live in the people's republic of china will be and remain, not our enemies, but our friends sep in the middle east, 100 million people in the arab countries, many of whom have considered us their enemy for nearly 20 years, now look on us as their friends sep we must continue to build on that friendship so that peace can settle at last over the middle east and so that the cradle of civilization will not become its grave sep together with the soviet union we have made the crucial breakthroughs that have begun the process of limiting nuclear arms sep but, we must set as our goal, not just limiting, but reducing and finally destroying these terrible weapons, so that they cannot destroy civilization sep and so that the threat of nuclear war will no longer hang over the world and the people sep we have opened a new relation with the soviet union sep we must continue to develop and expand that new relationship, so that the two strongest nations of the world will live together in cooperation rather than confrontation sep around the world -- in asia, in africa, in latin america, in the middle east -- there are millions of people who live in terrible poverty, even starvation sep we must keep as our goal turning away from production for war and expanding production for peace so that people everywhere on this earth can at last look forward, in their children's time, if not in our own time, to having the necessities for a decent life sep here, in america, we are fortunate that most of our people have not only the blessings of liberty but also the means to live full and good, and by the world's standards even abundant lives sep we must press on, however, toward a goal not only of more and better jobs but of full opportunity for every american, and of what we are striving so hard right now to achieve -- prosperity without inflation sep for more than a quarter of a century in public life, i have shared in the turbulent history of this evening sep i have fought for what i believe in sep i have tried, to the best of my ability, to discharge those duties and meet those responsibilities that were entrusted to me sep sometimes i have succeeded sep and sometimes i have failed sep but always i have taken heart from what theodore roosevelt once said about the man in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes short again and again because there is not effort without error and shortcoming, but who does actually strive to do the deed, who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, who spends himself in a worthy cause, who at the best knows in the end the triumphs of high achievements and with the worst if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly sep i pledge to you tonight that as long as i have a breath of life in my body, i shall continue in that spirit sep i shall continue to work for the great causes to which i have been dedicated throughout my years as a congressman, a senator, vice president and president, the cause of peace -- not just for america but among all nations -- prosperity, justice and opportunity for all of our people sep there is one cause above all to which i have been devoted and to which i shall always be devoted for as long as i live sep when i first took the oath of office as president five and a half years ago, i made this sacred commitment: to consecrate my office, my energies, and all the wisdom i can summon to the cause of peace among nations sep i've done my very best in all the days since to be true to that pledge sep as a result of these efforts, i am confident that the world is a safer place today, not only for the people of america but for the people of all nations, and that all of our children have a better chance than before of living in peace rather than dying in war sep this, more than anything, is what i hoped to achieve when i sought the presidency sep this, more than anything, is what i hope will be my legacy to you, to our country, as i leave the presidency sep to have served in this office is to have felt a very personal sense of kinship with each and every american sep in leaving it, i do so with this prayer: may god's grace be with you in all the days ahead
INTJ	it will be our wish and purpose that the processes of peace, when they are begun, shall be absolutely open and that they shall involve and permit henceforth no secret understandings of any kind sep the day of conquest and aggrandizement is gone by; so is also the day of secret covenants entered into in the interest of particular governments and likely at some unlooked-for moment to upset the peace of the world sep it is this happy fact, now clear to the view of every public man whose thoughts do not still linger in an age that is dead and gone, which makes it possible for every nation whose purposes are consistent with justice and the peace of the world to avow nor or at any other time the objects it has in view sep we entered this war because violations of right had occurred which touched us to the quick and made the life of our own people impossible unless they were corrected and the world secure once for all against their recurrence sep what we demand in this war, therefore, is nothing peculiar to ourselves sep it is that the world be made fit and safe to live in; and particularly that it be made safe for every peace-loving nation which, like our own, wishes to live its own life, determine its own institutions, be assured of justice and fair dealing by the other peoples of the world as against force and selfish aggression sep all the peoples of the world are in effect partners in this interest, and for our own part we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others it will not be done to us sep the program of the world's peace, therefore, is our program; and that program, the only possible program, as we see it, is this: i sep open covenants of peace, openly arrived at, after which there shall be no private international understandings of any kind but diplomacy shall proceed always frankly and in the public view sep ii sep absolute freedom of navigation upon the seas, outside territorial waters, alike in peace and in war, except as the seas may be closed in whole or in part by international action for the enforcement of international covenants sep iii sep the removal, so far as possible, of all economic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade conditions among all the nations consenting to the peace and associating themselves for its maintenance sep iv sep adequate guarantees given and taken that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest point consistent with domestic safety sep v sep a free, open-minded, and absolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims, based upon a strict observance of the principle that in determining all such questions of sovereignty the interests of the populations concerned must have equal weight with the equitable claims of the government whose title is to be determined sep vi sep the evacuation of all russian territory and such a settlement of all questions affecting russia as will secure the best and freest cooperation of the other nations of the world in obtaining for her an unhampered and unembarrassed opportunity for the independent determination of her own political development and national policy and assure her of a sincere welcome into the society of free nations under institutions of her own choosing; and, more than a welcome, assistance also of every kind that she may need and may herself desire sep the treatment accorded russia by her sister nations in the months to come will be the acid test of their good will, of their comprehension of her needs as distinguished from their own interests, and of their intelligent and unselfish sympathy sep vii sep belgium, the whole world will agree, must be evacuated and restored, without any attempt to limit the sovereignty which she enjoys in common with all other free nations sep no other single act will serve as this will serve to restore confidence among the nations in the laws which they have themselves set and determined for the government of their relations with one another sep without this healing act the whole structure and validity of international law is forever impaired sep viii sep all french territory should be freed and the invaded portions restored, and the wrong done to france by prussia in 1871 in the matter of alsace-lorraine, which has unsettled the peace of the world for nearly fifty years, should be righted, in order that peace may once more be made secure in the interest of all sep ix sep a readjustment of the frontiers of italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality sep x sep the peoples of austria-hungary, whose place among the nations we wish to see safeguarded and assured, should be accorded the freest opportunity to autonomous development sep xi sep rumania, serbia, and montenegro should be evacuated; occupied territories restored; serbia accorded free and secure access to the sea; and the relations of the several balkan states to one another determined by friendly counsel along historically established lines of allegiance and nationality; and international guarantees of the political and economic independence and territorial integrity of the several balkan states should be entered into sep xii sep the turkish portion of the present ottoman empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development, and the dardanelles should be permanently opened as a free passage to the ships and commerce of all nations under international guarantees sep xiii sep an independent polish state should be erected which should include the territories inhabited by indisputably polish populations, which should be assured a free and secure access to the sea, and whose political and economic independence and territorial integrity should be guaranteed by international covenant sep xiv sep a general association of nations must be formed under specific covenants for the purpose of affording mutual guarantees of political independence and territorial integrity to great and small states alike sep in regard to these essential rectifications of wrong and assertions of right we feel ourselves to be intimate partners of all the governments and peoples associated together against the imperialists sep we cannot be separated in interest or divided in purpose sep we stand together until the end sep for such arrangements and covenants we are willing to fight and to continue to fight until they are achieved; but only because we wish the right to prevail and desire a just and stable peace such as can be secured only by removing the chief provocations to war, which this program does remove sep we have no jealousy of german greatness, and there is nothing in this program that impairs it sep we grudge her no achievement or distinction of learning or of pacific enterprise such as have made her record very bright an d very enviable sep we do not wish to injure her or to block in any way her legitimate influence or power sep we do not wish to fight her either with arms or with hostile arrangements of trade if she is willing to associate herself with us and the other peace-loving nations of the world in covenants of justice and law and fair dealing sep we wish her only to accept a place of equality among the peoples of the world -- the new world in which we now live -- instead of a place of mastery
ENTJ	mr sep president, mr sep speaker, members of the 77th congress: i address you, the members of this new congress, at a moment unprecedented in the history of the union sep i use the word unprecedented because at no previous time has american security been as seriously threatened from without as it is today sep since the permanent formation of our government under the constitution in 1789, most of the periods of crisis in our history have related to our domestic affairs sep and, fortunately, only one of these -- the four-year war between the states -- ever threatened our national unity sep today, thank god, 130,000,000 americans in 48 states have forgotten points of the compass in our national unity sep it is true that prior to 1914 the united states often has been disturbed by events in other continents sep we have even engaged in two wars with european nations and in a number of undeclared wars in the west indies, in the mediterranean and in the pacific, for the maintenance of american rights and for the principles of peaceful commerce sep but in no case had a serious threat been raised against our national safety or our continued independence sep what i seek to convey is the historic truth that the united states as a nation has at all times maintained opposition -- clear, definite opposition -- to any attempt to lock us in behind an ancient chinese wall while the procession of civilization went past sep today, thinking of our children and of their children, we oppose enforced isolation for ourselves or for any other part of the americas sep that determination of ours, extending over all these years, was proved, for example, in the early days during the quarter century of wars following the french revolution sep while the napoleonic struggles did threaten interests of the united states because of the french foothold in the west indies and in louisiana, and while we engaged in the war of 1812 to vindicate our right to peaceful trade, it is nevertheless clear that neither france nor great britain nor any other nation was aiming at domination of the whole world sep and in like fashion, from 1815 to 1914 -- ninety-nine years -- no single war in europe or in asia constituted a real threat against our future or against the future of any other american nation sep except in the maximilian interlude in mexico, no foreign power sought to establish itself in this hemisphere sep and the strength of the british fleet in the atlantic has been a friendly strength; it is still a friendly strength sep even when the world war broke out in 1914, it seemed to contain only small threat of danger to our own american future sep but as time went on, as we remember, the american people began to visualize what the downfall of democratic nations might mean to our own democracy sep we need not overemphasize imperfections in the peace of versailles sep we need not harp on failure of the democracies to deal with problems of world reconstruction sep we should remember that the peace of 1919 was far less unjust than the kin" of pacification which began even before munich, and which is being carried on under the new order of tyranny that seeks to spread over every continent today sep the american people have unalterably set their faces against that tyranny sep i suppose that every realist knows that the democratic way of life is at this moment being directly assailed in every part of the world -- assailed either by arms or by secret spreading of poisonous propaganda by those who seek to destroy unity and promote discord in nations that are still at peace sep during 16 long months this assault has blotted out the whole pattern of democratic life in an appalling number of independent nations, great and small sep and the assailants are still on the march, threatening other nations, great and small sep therefore, as your president, performing my constitutional duty to "give to the congress information of the state of the union," i find it unhappily necessary to report that the future and the safety of our country and of our democracy are overwhelmingly involved in events far beyond our borders sep armed defense of democratic existence is now being gallantly waged in four continents sep if that defense fails, all the population and all the resources of europe and asia, and africa and austral-asia will be dominated by conquerors sep and let us remember that the total of those populations in those four continents, the total of those populations and their resources greatly exceed the sum total of the population and the resources of the whole of the western hemisphere -- yes, many times over sep in times like these it is immature -- and, incidentally, untrue -- for anybody to brag that an unprepared america, single-handed and with one hand tied behind its back, can hold off the whole world sep no realistic american can expect from a dictators peace international generosity, or return of true independence, or world disarmament, or freedom of expression, or freedom of religion -- or even good business sep such a peace would bring no security for us or for our neighbors sep those who would give up essential liberty to purchase a little temporary safety deserve neither liberty nor safety sep as a nation we may take pride in the fact that we are soft-hearted; but we cannot afford t"be soft-headed sep we must always be wary of those who with sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal preach the "ism" of appeasement sep we must especially beware of that small group of selfish men who would clip the wings of the american eagle in order to feather their own nests sep i have recently pointed out how quickly the tempo of modern warfare could bring into our very midst the physical attack which we must eventually expect if the dictator nations win this war sep there is much loose talk of our immunity from immediate and direct invasion from across the seas sep obviously, as long as the british navy retains its power, no such danger exists sep even if there were no british navy, it is not probable that any enemy would be stupid enough to attack us by landing troops in the united states from across thousands of miles of ocean, until it had acquired strategic bases from which to operate sep but we learn much from the lessons of the past years in europe -- particularly the lesson of norway, whose essential seaports were captured by treachery and surprise built up over a series of years sep the first phase of the invasion of this hemisphere would not be the landing of regular troops sep the necessary strategic points would be occupied by secret agents and by their dupes -- and great numbers of them are already here and in latin america sep as long as the aggressor nations maintain the offensive they, not we, will choose the time and the place and the method of their attack sep and that is why the future of all the american republics is today in serious danger sep that is why this annual message to the congress is unique in our history sep that is why every member of the executive branch of the government and every member of the congress face great responsibility, great accountability sep the need of the moment is that our actions and our policy should be devoted primarily -- almost exclusively -- to meeting this foreign peril sep for all our domestic problems are now a part of the great emergency sep just as our national policy in internal affairs has been based upon a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all our fellow men within our gates, so our national policy in foreign affairs has been based on a decent respect for the rights and the dignity of all nations, large and small sep and the justice of morality must and will win in the end sep our national policy is this: first, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to all-inclusive national defense sep secondly, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to full support of all those resolute people everywhere who are resisting aggression and are thereby keeping war away from our hemisphere sep by this support we express our determination that the democratic cause shall prevail, and we strengthen the defense and the security of our own nation sep third, by an impressive expression of the public will and without regard to partisanship, we are committed to the proposition that principles of morality and considerations for our own security will never permit us to acquiesce in a peace dictated by aggressors and sponsored by appeasers sep we know that enduring peace cannot be bought at the cost of other people's freedom sep in the recent national election there was no substantial difference between the two great parties in respect to that national policy sep no issue was fought out on this line before the american electorate sep and today it is abundantly evident that american citizens everywhere are demanding and supporting speedy and complete action in recognition of obvious danger sep therefore, the immediate need is a swift and driving increase in our armament production sep leaders of industry and labor have responded to our summons sep goals of speed have been set sep in some cases these goals are being reached ahead of time sep in some cases we are on schedule; in other cases there are slight but not serious delays sep and in some cases -- and, i am sorry to say, very important cases -- we are all concerned by the slowness of the accomplishment of our plans sep the army and navy, however, have made substantial progress during the past year sep actual experience is improving and speeding up our methods of production with every passing day sep and today's best is not good enough for tomorrow sep i am not satisfied with the progress thus far made sep the men in charge of the program represent the best in training, in ability, and in patriotism sep they are not satisfied with the progress thus far made sep none of us will be satisfied until the job is done sep no matter whether the original goal was set too high or too low, our objective is quicker and better results sep to give you two illustrations: we are behind schedule in turning out finished airplanes sep we are working day and night to solve the innumerable problems and to catch up sep we are ahead of schedule in building warships, but we are working to get even further ahead of that schedule sep to change a whole nation from a basis of peacetime production of implements of peace to a basis of wartime production of implements of war is no small task sep and the greatest difficulty comes at the beginning of the program, when new tools, new plant facilities, new assembly lines, new shipways must first be constructed before the actual material begins to flow steadily and speedily from them sep the congress of course, must rightly keep itself informed at all times of the progress of the program sep however, there is certain information, as the congress itself will readily recognize, which, in the interests of our own security and those of the nations that we are supporting, must of needs be kept in confidence sep new circumstances are constantly begetting new needs for our safety sep i shall ask this congress for greatly increased new appropriations and authorizations to carry on what we have begun sep i also ask this congress for authority and for funds sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war with aggressor nations sep our most useful and immediate role is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves sep they do not need manpower, but they do need billions of dollars worth of the weapons of defense sep the time is near when they will not be able to pay for them all in ready cash sep we cannot, and we will not, tell them that they must surrender merely because of present inability to pay for the weapons which we kno"they must have sep i do not recommend that we make them a loan of dollars with which to pay for these weapons -- a loan to be repaid in dollars sep i recommend that we make it possible for those nations to continue to obtain war materials in the united states, fitting their orders into our own program sep and nearly all of their material would, if the time ever came, be useful in our own defense sep taking counsel of expert military and naval authorities, considering what is best for our own security, we are free to decide how much should be kept here and how much should be sent abroad to our friends who, by their determined and heroic resistance, are giving us time in which to make ready our own defense sep for what we send abroad we shall be repaid, repaid within a reasonable time following the close of hostilities, repaid in similar materials, or at our option in other goods of many kinds which they can produce and which we need sep let us say to the democracies: "we americans are vitally concerned in your defense of freedom sep we are putting forth our energies, our resources, and our organizing powers to give you the strength to regain and maintain a free world sep we shall send you in ever-increasing numbers, ships, planes, tanks, guns sep that is our purpose and our pledge sep "in fulfillment of this purpose we will not be intimidated by the threats of dictators that they will regard as a breach of international law or as an act of war our aid to the democracies which dare to resist their aggression sep such aid -- such aid is not an act of war, even if a dictator should unilaterally proclaim it so to be sep and when the dictators -- if the dictators -- are ready to make war upon us, they will not wait for an act of war on our part sep they did not wait for norway or belgium or the netherlands to commit an act of war sep their only interest is in a new one-way international law, which lacks mutuality in its observance and therefore becomes an instrument of oppression sep the happiness of future generations of americans may well depend on how effective and how immediate we can make our aid felt sep no one can tell the exact character of the emergency situations that we may be called upon to meet sep the nation's hands must not be tied when the nation's life is in danger sep yes, and we must prepare, all of us prepare, to make the sacrifices that the emergency -- almost as serious as war itself -- demands sep whatever stands in the way of speed and efficiency in defense, in defense preparations of any kind, must give way to the national need sep a free nation has the right to expect full cooperation from all groups sep a free nation has the right to look to the leaders of business, of labor, and of agriculture to take the lead in stimulating effort, not among other groups but within their own group sep the best way of dealing with the few slackers or trouble-makers in our midst is, first, to shame them by patriotic example, and if that fails, to use the sovereignty of government to save government sep as men do not live by bread alone, they do not fight by armaments alone sep those who man our defenses and those behind them who build our defenses must have the stamina and the courage which come from unshakable belief in the manner of life which they are defending sep the mighty action that we are calling for cannot be based on a disregard of all the things worth fighting for sep the nation takes great satisfaction and much strength from the things which have been done to make its people conscious of their individual stake in the preservation of democratic life in america sep those things have toughened the fiber of our people, have renewed their faith and strengthened their devotion to the institutions we make ready to protect sep certainly this is no time for any of us to stop thinking about the social and economic problems which are the root cause of the social revolution which is today a supreme factor in the world sep for there is nothing mysterious about the foundations of a healthy and strong democracy sep the basic things expected by our people of their political and economic systems are simple sep they are: equality of opportunity for youth and for others sep jobs for those who can work sep security for those who need it sep the ending of special privilege for the few sep the preservation of civil liberties for all sep the enjoyment -- the enjoyment of the fruits of scientific progress in a wider and constantly rising standard of living sep these are the simple, the basic things that must never be lost sight of in the turmoil and unbelievable complexity of our modern world sep the inner and abiding strength of our economic and political systems is dependent upon the degree to which they fulfill these expectations sep many subjects connected with our social economy call for immediate improvement sep as examples: we should bring more citizens under the coverage of old-age pensions and unemployment insurance sep we should widen the opportunities for adequate medical care sep we should plan a better system by which persons deserving or needing gainful employment may obtain it sep i have called for personal sacrifice, and i am assured of the willingness of almost all americans to respond to that call sep a part of the sacrifice means the payment of more money in taxes sep in my budget message i will recommend that a greater portion of this great defense program be paid for from taxation than we are paying for today sep no person should try, or be allowed to get rich out of the program, and the principle of tax payments in accordance with ability to pay should be constantly before our eyes to guide our legislation sep if the congress maintains these principles the voters, putting patriotism ahead pocketbooks, will give you their applause sep in the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world
ENFJ	mr sep chairman, ladies and gentlemen: i need not pause to say how very delighted i am to be here tonight, and how very delighted i am to see you expressing your concern about the issues that will be discussed tonight by turning out in such large numbers sep i also want to say that i consider it a great honor to share this program with dr sep bennett, dr sep commager, and rabbi heschel, and some of the distinguished leaders and personalities of our nation sep and of course its always good to come back to riverside church sep over the last eight years, i have had the privilege of preaching here almost "ery year in that period, and it is always a rich and rewarding experience to come to this great church and this great pulpit sep i come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice sep i join you in this meeting because i'm in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together: clergy and laymen concerned about vietnam sep the recent statements of your executive committee are the sentiments of my own heart, and i found myself in full accord when i read its opening lines: "a time comes when silence is betrayal sep " and that time has come for us in relation to vietnam sep the truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one sep even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war sep nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world sep moreover, when the issues at hand seem as perplexing as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty; but we must move on sep and some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak sep we must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak sep and we must rejoice as well, for surely this is the first time in our nation's history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history sep perhaps a new spirit is rising among us sep if it is, let us trace its movements and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance, for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us sep over the past two years, as i have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as i have called for radical departures from the destruction of vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path sep at the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud: "why are you speaking about the war, dr sep king sep " "why are you joining the voices of dissent sep " "peace and civil rights don't mix," they say sep "aren't you hurting the cause of your people," they ask sep and when i hear them, though i often understand the source of their concern, i am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling sep indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live sep in the light of such tragic misunderstanding, i deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly, and i trust concisely, why i believe that the path from dexter avenue baptist church -- the church in montgomery, alabama, where i began my pastorate -- leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight sep i come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation sep this speech is not addressed to hanoi or to the national liberation front sep it is not addressed to china or to russia sep nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of vietnam sep neither is it an attempt to make north vietnam or the national liberation front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they must play in the successful resolution of the problem sep while they both may have justifiable reasons to be suspicious of the good faith of the united states, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides sep tonight, however, i wish not to speak with hanoi and the national liberation front, but rather to my fellow americans sep since i am a preacher by calling, i suppose it is not surprising that i have seven major reasons for bringing vietnam into the field of my moral vision sep there is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in vietnam and the struggle i, and others, have been waging in america sep a few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle sep it seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor -- both black and white -- through the poverty program sep there were experiments, hopes, new beginnings sep then came the buildup in vietnam, and i watched this program broken and eviscerated, as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and i knew that america would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube sep so, i was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such sep perhaps a more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home sep it was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population sep we were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in southeast asia which they had not found in southwest georgia and east harlem sep and so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching negro and white boys on tv screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools sep and so we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would hardly live on the same block in chicago sep i could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor sep my third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the north over the last three years -- especially the last three summers sep as i have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, i have told them that molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems sep i have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action sep but they ask -- and rightly so -- what about vietnam sep they ask if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted sep their questions hit home, and i knew that i could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today -- my own government sep for the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, i cannot be silent sep for those who ask the question, "aren't you a civil rights leader sep " and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, i have this further answer sep in 1957 when a group of us formed the southern christian leadership conference, we chose as our motto: "to save the soul of america sep " we were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that america would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear sep in a way we were agreeing with langston hughes, that black bard of harlem, who had written earlier: o, yes,i say it plain,america never was america to me,and yet i swear this oath --america will be sep now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of america today can ignore the present war sep if america's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: vietnam sep it can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over sep so it is that those of us who are yet determined that america will be -- are -- are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land sep as if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of america were not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in 1954; 1 and i cannot forget that the nobel peace prize was also a commission, a commission to work harder than i had ever worked before for "the brotherhood of man sep " this is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present i would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of jesus christ sep to me the relationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that i sometimes marvel at those who ask me why i'm speaking against the war sep could it be that they do not know that the good news was meant for all men -- for communist and capitalist, for their children and ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and conservative sep have they forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the one who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them sep what then can i say to the vietcong or to castro or to mao as a faithful minister of this one sep can i threaten them with death or must i not share with them my life sep and finally, as i try to explain for you and for myself the road that leads from montgomery to this place i would have offered all that was most valid if i simply said that i must be true to my conviction that i share with all men the calling to be a son of the living god sep beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood, and because i believe that the father is deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and outcast children, i come tonight to speak for them sep this i believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions sep we are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation and for those it calls "enemy," for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers sep and as i ponder the madness of vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond in compassion, my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula sep i speak now not of the soldiers of each side, not of the ideologies of the liberation front, not of the junta in saigon, but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now sep i think of them, too, because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries sep they must see americans as strange liberators sep the vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1954 -- in 1945 rather -- after a combined french and japanese occupation and before the communist revolution in china sep they were led by ho chi minh sep even though they quoted the american declaration of independence in their own document of freedom, we refused to recognize them sep instead, we decided to support france in its reconquest of her former colony sep our government felt then that the vietnamese people were not ready for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long sep with that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking self-determination and a government that had been established not by china -- for whom the vietnamese have no great love -- but by clearly indigenous forces that included some communists sep for the peasants this new government meant real land reform, one of the most important needs in their lives sep for nine years following 1945 we denied the people of vietnam the right of independence sep for nine years we vigorously supported the french in their abortive effort to recolonize vietnam sep before the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the french war costs sep even before the french were defeated at dien bien phu, they began to despair of their reckless action, but we did not sep we encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost the will sep soon we would be paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt at recolonization sep after the french were defeated, it looked as if independence and land reform would come again through the geneva agreement sep but instead there came the united states, determined that ho should not unify the temporarily divided nation, and the peasants watched again as we supported one of the most vicious modern dictators, our chosen man, premier diem sep the peasants watched and cringed as diem ruthlessly rooted out all opposition, supported their extortionist landlords, and refused even to discuss reunification with the north sep the peasants watched as all this was presided over by united states' influence and then by increasing numbers of united states troops who came to help quell the insurgency that diem's methods had aroused sep when diem was overthrown they may have been happy, but the long line of military dictators seemed to offer no real change, especially in terms of their need for land and peace sep the only change came from america, as we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support sep all the while the people read our leaflets and received the regular promises of peace and democracy and land reform sep now they languish under our bombs and consider us, not their fellow vietnamese, the real enemy sep they move sadly and apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met sep they know they must move on or be destroyed by our bombs sep so they go, primarily women and children and the aged sep they watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of their crops sep they must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees sep they wander into the hospitals with at least twenty casualties from american firepower for one vietcong-inflicted injury sep so far we may have killed a million of them, mostly children sep they wander into the towns and see thousands of the children, homeless, without clothes, running in packs on the streets like animals sep they see the children degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food sep they see the children selling their sisters to our soldiers, soliciting for their mothers sep what do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform sep what do they think as we test out our latest weapons on them, just as the germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of europe sep where are the roots of the independent vietnam we claim to be building sep is it among these voiceless ones sep we have destroyed their two most cherished institutions: the family and the village sep we have destroyed their land and their crops sep we have cooperated in the crushing -- in the crushing of the nation's only non-communist revolutionary political force, the unified buddhist church sep we have supported the enemies of the peasants of saigon sep we have corrupted their women and children and killed their men sep now there is little left to build on, save bitterness sep soon, the only solid -- solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call "fortified hamlets sep " the peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new vietnam on such grounds as these sep could we blame them for such thoughts sep we must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise sep these, too, are our brothers sep perhaps a more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for those who have been designated as our enemies sep what of the national liberation front, that strangely anonymous group we call "vc" or "communists" sep what must they think of the united states of america when they realize that we permitted the repression and cruelty of diem, which helped to bring them into being as a resistance group in the south sep what do they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own taking up of arms sep how can they believe in our integrity when now we speak of "aggression from the north" as if there were nothing more essential to the war sep how can they trust us when now we charge them with violence after the murderous reign of diem and charge them with violence while we pour every new weapon of death into their land sep surely we must understand their feelings, even if we do not condone their actions sep surely we must see that the men we supported pressed them to their violence sep surely we must see that our own computerized plans of destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts sep how do they judge us when our officials know that their membership is less than twenty-five percent communist, and yet insist on giving them the blanket name sep what must they be thinking when they know that we are aware of their control of major sections of vietnam, and yet we appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly organized political parallel government will not have a part sep they ask how we can speak of free elections when the saigon press is censored and controlled by the military junta sep and they are surely right to wonder what kind of new government we plan to help form without them, the only party in real touch with the peasants sep they question our political goals and they deny the reality of a peace settlement from which they will be excluded sep their questions are frighteningly relevant sep is our nation planning to build on political myth again, and then shore it up upon the power of new violence sep here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence, when it helps us to see the enemy's point of view, to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves sep for from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition sep so, too, with hanoi sep in the north, where our bombs now pummel the land, and our mines endanger the waterways, we are met by a deep but understandable mistrust sep to speak for them is to explain this lack of confidence in western words, and especially their distrust of american intentions now sep in hanoi are the men who led the nation to independence against the japanese and the french, the men who sought membership in the french commonwealth and were betrayed by the weakness of paris and the willfulness of the colonial armies sep it was they who led a second struggle against french domination at tremendous costs, and then were persuaded to give up the land they controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as a temporary measure at geneva sep after 1954 they watched us conspire with diem to prevent elections which could have surely brought ho chi minh to power over a united vietnam, and they realized they had been betrayed again sep when we ask why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be remembered sep also, it must be clear that the leaders of hanoi considered the presence of american troops in support of the diem regime to have been the initial military breach of the geneva agreement concerning foreign troops sep they remind us that they did not begin to send troops in large numbers and even supplies into the south until american forces had moved into the tens of thousands sep hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier north vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made sep ho chi minh has watched as america has spoken of peace and built up its forces, and now he has surely heard the increasing international rumors of american plans for an invasion of the north sep he knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy sep perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor, weak nation more than eight hundred -- rather, eight thousand miles away from its shores sep at this point i should make it clear that while i have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called "enemy," i am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else sep for it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy sep we are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved sep before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor sep somehow this madness must cease sep we must stop now sep i speak as a child of god and brother to the suffering poor of vietnam sep i speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted sep i speak of the -- for the poor of america who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home, and death and corruption in vietnam sep i speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken sep i speak as one who loves america, to the leaders of our own nation: the great initiative in this war is ours; the initiative to stop it must be ours sep this is the message of the great buddhist leaders of vietnam sep recently one of them wrote these words, and i quote: each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of the vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian instinct sep the americans are forcing even their friends into becoming their enemies sep it is curious that the americans, who calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do not realize that in the process they are incurring deep psychological and political defeat sep the image of america will never again be the image of revolution, freedom, and democracy, but the image of violence and militarism (unquote) sep if we continue, there will be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in vietnam sep if we do not stop our war against the people of vietnam immediately, the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this as some horrible, clumsy, and deadly game we have decided to play sep the world now demands a maturity of america that we may not be able to achieve sep it demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in vietnam, that we have been detrimental to the life of the vietnamese people sep the situation is one in which we must be ready to turn sharply from our present ways sep in order to atone for our sins and errors in vietnam, we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war sep i would like to suggest five concrete things that our government should do [immediately] to begin the long and difficult process of extricating ourselves from this nightmarish conflict: number one: end all bombing in north and south vietnam sep number two: declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will create the atmosphere for negotiation sep three: take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in southeast asia by curtailing our military buildup in thailand and our interference in laos sep four: realistically accept the fact that the national liberation front has substantial support in south vietnam and must thereby play a role in any meaningful negotiations and any future vietnam government sep five: set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from vietnam in accordance with the 1954 geneva agreement sep part of our ongoing -- part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to any vietnamese who fears for his life under a new regime which included the liberation front sep then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we have done sep we must provide the medical aid that is badly needed, making it available in this country, if necessary sep meanwhile -- meanwhile, we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government to disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment sep we must continue to raise our voices and our lives if our nation persists in its perverse ways in vietnam sep we must be prepared to match actions with words by seeking out every creative method of protest possible sep as we counsel young men concerning military service, we must clarify for them our nation's role in vietnam and challenge them with the alternative of conscientious objection sep i am pleased to say that this is a path now chosen by more than seventy students at my own alma mater, morehouse college, and i recommend it to all who find the american course in vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one sep moreover, i would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors sep these are the times for real choices and not false ones sep we are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly sep every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest sep now there is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in vietnam sep i say we must enter that struggle, but i wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing sep the war in vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the american spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality sep sep sep and if we ignore this sobering reality, we will find ourselves organizing "clergy and laymen concerned" committees for the next generation sep they will be concerned about guatemala -- guatemala and peru sep they will be concerned about thailand and cambodia sep they will be concerned about mozambique and south africa sep we will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end, unless there is a significant and profound change in american life and policy sep and so, such thoughts take us beyond vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the living god sep in 1957, a sensitive american official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution sep during the past ten years, we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which has now justified the presence of u sep s sep military advisors in venezuela sep this need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts for the counterrevolutionary action of american forces in guatemala sep it tells why american helicopters are being used against guerrillas in cambodia and why american napalm and green beret forces have already been active against rebels in peru sep it is with such activity in mind that the words of the late john f sep kennedy come back to haunt us sep five years ago he said, "those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable sep " increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments sep i am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values sep we must rapidly begin sep sep sep we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society sep when machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered sep a true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies sep on the one hand, we are called to play the good samaritan on life's roadside, but that will be only an initial act sep one day we must come to see that the whole jericho road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway sep true compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar sep it comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring sep a true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth sep with righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the west investing huge sums of money in asia, africa, and south america, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, "this is not just sep " it will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of south america and say, "this is not just sep " the western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just sep a true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, "this way of settling differences is not just sep " this business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love sep a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death sep america, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values sep there is nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war sep there is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood sep this kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism sep war is not the answer sep communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons sep let us not join those who shout war and, through their misguided passions, urge the united states to relinquish its participation in the united nations sep these are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness sep we must not engage in a negative anticommunism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy, realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action in behalf of justice sep we must with positive action seek to remove those conditions of poverty, insecurity, and injustice, which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops sep these are revolutionary times sep all over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppressi
ISFJ	thank you very, very much, president keohane sep mrs sep gorbachev, trustees, faculty, parents, and i should say, julia porter, class president, and certainly my new best friend, christine bicknell -- and, of course, the class of 1990 sep i am really thrilled to be here today, and very excited, as i know all of you must be, that mrs sep gorbachev could join us sep these -- these are exciting times sep they're exciting in washington, and i have really looked forward to coming to wellesley sep i thought it was going to be fun sep i never dreamt it would be this much fun sep so, thank you for that sep more than ten years ago, when i was invited here to talk about our experiences in the people's republic of china, i was struck by both the natural beauty of your campus and the spirit of this place sep wellesley, you see, is not just a place but an idea -- an experiment in excellence in which diversity is not just tolerated, but is embraced sep the essence of this spirit was captured in a moving speech about tolerance given last year by a student body president of one of your sister colleges sep she related the story by robert fulghum about a young pastor, finding himself in charge of some very energetic children, hits upon the game called "giants, wizards, and dwarfs sep " "you have to decide now," the pastor instructed the children, "which you are -- a giant, a wizard, or a dwarf sep " at that, a small girl tugging at his pants leg, asked, "but where do the mermaids stand sep " and the pastor tells her there are no mermaids sep and she says, "oh yes there are -- they are sep i am a mermaid sep "now this little girl knew what she was, and she was not about to give up on either her identity, or the game sep she intended to take her place wherever mermaids fit into the scheme of things sep "where do the mermaids stand sep all of those who are different, those who do not fit the boxes and the pigeonholes sep " "answer that question," wrote fulghum, "and you can build a school, a nation, or a whole world sep " as that very wise young woman said, "diversity, like anything worth having, requires effort -- effort to learn about and respect difference, to be compassionate with one another, to cherish our own identity, and to accept unconditionally the same in others sep you should all be very proud that this is the wellesley spirit sep now i know your first choice today was alice walker -- guess how i know sep -- known for the color purple sep instead you got me -- known for the color of my hair sep alice walker's book has a special resonance here sep at wellesley, each class is known by a special color sep for four years the class of '90 has worn the color purple sep today you meet on severance green to say goodbye to all of that, to begin a new and a very personal journey, to search for your own true colors sep in the world that awaits you, beyond the shores of waban -- lake waban, no one can say what your true colors will be sep but this i do know: you have a first class education from a first class school sep and so you need not, probably cannot, live a "paint-by-numbers" life sep decisions are not irrevocable sep choices do come back sep and as you set off from wellesley, i hope that many of you will consider making three very special choices sep the first is to believe in something larger than yourself, to get involved in some of the big ideas of our time sep i chose literacy because i honestly believe that if more people could read, write, and comprehend, we would be that much closer to solving so many of the problems that plague our nation and our society sep and early on i made another choice, which i hope you'll make as well sep whether you are talking about education, career, or service, you're talking about life -- and life really must have joy sep it's supposed to be fun sep one of the reasons i made the most important decision of my life, to marry george bush, is because he made me laugh sep it's true, sometimes we've laughed through our tears, but that shared laughter has been one of our strongest bonds sep find the joy in life, because as ferris bueller said on his day off, "life moves pretty fast; and you don't stop and look around once in a while, you're going to miss it sep "(i'm not going to tell george you clapped more for ferris than you clapped for george sep )the third choice that must not be missed is to cherish your human connections: your relationships with family and friends sep for several years, you've had impressed upon you the importance to your career of dedication and hard work sep and, of course, that's true sep but as important as your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, a business leader will be, you are a human being first sep and those human connections --- with spouses, with children, with friends -- are the most important investments you will ever make sep at the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, winning one more verdict, or not closing one more deal sep you will regret time not spent with a husband, a child, a friend, or a parent sep we are in a transitional period right now -- we are in a transitional period right now, fascinating and exhilarating times, learning to adjust to changes and the choices we, men and women, are facing sep as an example, i remember what a friend said, on hearing her husband complain to his buddies that he had to babysit sep quickly setting him straight, my friend told her husband that when it's your own kids, it's not called babysitting sep now maybe we should adjust faster; maybe we should adjust slower sep but whatever the era twenty -- whatever the era, whatever the times, one thing will never change: fathers and mothers, if you have children, they must come first sep you must read to your children, and you must hug your children, and you must love your children sep your success as a family, our success as a society, depends not on what happens in the white house, but on what happens inside your house sep for over fifty years, it was said that the winner of wellesley's annual hoop race would be the first to get married sep now they say, the winner will be the first to become a c sep e sep o sep both -- both of those stereotypes show too little tolerance for those who want to know where the mermaids stand sep so -- so i want to offer a new legend: the winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her dream -- not society's dreams -- her own personal dream sep and who -- who knows sep somewhere out in this audience may even be someone who will one day follow in my footsteps, and preside over the white house as the president's spouse -- and i wish him well sep well, the controversy ends here sep but our conversation is only beginning sep and a worthwhile conversation it has been sep so as you leave wellesley today, take with you deep thanks for the courtesy and the honor you have shared with mrs sep gorbachev and with me sep thank you sep god bless you sep and may your future be worthy of your dreams
ESFP	good evening, my fellow citizens: this afternoon, following a series of threats and defiant statements, the presence of alabama national guardsmen was required on the university of alabama to carry out the final and unequivocal order of the united states district court of the northern district of alabama sep that order called for the admission of two clearly qualified young alabama residents who happened to have been born negro sep that they were admitted peacefully on the campus is due in good measure to the conduct of the students of the university of alabama, who met their responsibilities in a constructive way sep i hope that every american, regardless of where he lives, will stop and examine his conscience about this and other related incidents sep this nation was founded by men of many nations and backgrounds sep it was founded on the principle that all men are created equal, and that the rights of every man are diminished when the rights of one man are threatened sep today, we are committed to a worldwide struggle to promote and protect the rights of all who wish to be free sep and when americans are sent to vietnam or west berlin, we do not ask for whites only sep it ought to be possible, therefore, for american students of any color to attend any public institution they select without having to be backed up by troops sep it ought to to be possible for american consumers of any color to receive equal service in places of public accommodation, such as hotels and restaurants and theaters and retail stores, without being forced to resort to demonstrations in the street, and it ought to be possible for american citizens of any color to register and to vote in a free election without interference or fear of reprisal sep it ought to to be possible, in short, for every american to enjoy the privileges of being american without regard to his race or his color sep in short, every american ought to have the right to be treated as he would wish to be treated, as one would wish his children to be treated sep but this is not the case sep the negro baby born in america today, regardless of the section of the state in which he is born, has about one-half as much chance of completing a high school as a white baby born in the same place on the same day, one-third as much chance of completing college, one-third as much chance of becoming a professional man, twice as much chance of becoming unemployed, about one-seventh as much chance of earning $10,000 a year, a life expectancy which is 7 years shorter, and the prospects of earning only half as much sep this is not a sectional issue sep difficulties over segregation and discrimination exist in every city, in every state of the union, producing in many cities a rising tide of discontent that threatens the public safety sep nor is this a partisan issue sep in a time of domestic crisis men of good will and generosity should be able to unite regardless of party or politics sep this is not even a legal or legislative issue alone sep it is better to settle these matters in the courts than on the streets, and new laws are needed at every level, but law alone cannot make men see right sep we are confronted primarily with a moral issue sep it is as old as the scriptures and is as clear as the american constitution sep the heart of the question is whether all americans are to be afforded equal rights and equal opportunities, whether we are going to treat our fellow americans as we want to be treated sep if an american, because his skin is dark, cannot eat lunch in a restaurant open to the public, if he cannot send his children to the best public school available, if he cannot vote for the public officials who will represent him, if, in short, he cannot enjoy the full and free life which all of us want, then who among us would be content to have the color of his skin changed and stand in his place sep who among us would then be content with the counsels of patience and delay sep one hundred years of delay have passed since president lincoln freed the slaves, yet their heirs, their grandsons, are not fully free sep they are not yet freed from the bonds of injustice sep they are not yet freed from social and economic oppression sep and this nation, for all its hopes and all its boasts, will not be fully free until all its citizens are free sep we preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home, but are we to say to the world, and much more importantly, to each other that this is the land of the free except for the negroes; that we have no second-class citizens except negroes; that we have no class or caste system, no ghettoes, no master race except with respect to negroes sep now the time has come for this nation to fulfill its promise sep the events in birmingham and elsewhere have so increased the cries for equality that no city or state or legislative body can prudently choose to ignore them sep the fires of frustration and discord are burning in every city, north and south, where legal remedies are not at hand sep redress is sought in the streets, in demonstrations, parades, and protests which create tensions and threaten violence and threaten lives sep we face, therefore, a moral crisis as a country and a people sep it cannot be met by repressive police action sep it cannot be left to increased demonstrations in the streets sep it cannot be quieted by token moves or talk sep it is a time to act in the congress, in your state and local legislative body and, above all, in all of our daily lives sep it is not enough to pin the blame on others, to say this a problem of one section of the country or another, or deplore the facts that we face sep a great change is at hand, and our task, our obligation, is to make that revolution, that change, peaceful and constructive for all sep those who do nothing are inviting shame, as well as violence sep those who act boldly are recognizing right, as well as reality sep next week i shall ask the congress of the united states to act, to make a commitment it has not fully made in this century to the proposition that race has no place in american life or law sep the federal judiciary has upheld that proposition in a series of forthright cases sep the executive branch has adopted that proposition in the conduct of its affairs, including the employment of federal personnel, the use of federal facilities, and the sale of federally financed housing sep but there are other necessary measures which only the congress can provide, and they must be provided at this session sep the old code of equity law under which we live commands for every wrong a remedy, but in too many communities, in too many parts of the country, wrongs are inflicted on negro citizens and there are no remedies at law sep unless the congress acts, their only remedy is the street sep i am, therefore, asking the congress to enact legislation giving all americans the right to be served in facilities which are open to the public -- hotels, restaurants, theaters, retail stores, and similar establishments sep this seems to me to be an elementary right sep its denial is an arbitrary indignity that no american in 1963 should have to endure, but many do sep i have recently met with scores of business leaders urging them to take voluntary action to end this discrimination, and i have been encouraged by their response, and in the last two weeks over 75 cities have seen progress made in desegregating these kinds of facilities sep but many are unwilling to act alone, and for this reason, nationwide legislation is needed if we are to move this problem from the streets to the courts sep i'm also asking the congress to authorize the federal government to participate more fully in lawsuits designed to end segregation in public education sep we have succeeded in persuading many districts to desegregate voluntarily sep dozens have admitted negroes without violence sep today, a negro is attending a state-supported institution in every one of our 50 states, but the pace is very slow sep too many negro children entering segregated grade schools at the time of the supreme court's decision nine years ago will enter segregated high schools this fall, having suffered a loss which can never be restored sep the lack of an adequate education denies the negro a chance to get a decent job sep the orderly implementation of the supreme court decision, therefore, cannot be left solely to those who may not have the economic resources to carry the legal action or who may be subject to harassment sep other features will be also requested, including greater protection for the right to vote sep but legislation, i repeat, cannot solve this problem alone sep it must be solved in the homes of every american in every community across our country sep in this respect i wanna pay tribute to those citizens north and south who've been working in their communities to make life better for all sep they are acting not out of sense of legal duty but out of a sense of human decency sep like our soldiers and sailors in all parts of the world they are meeting freedom's challenge on the firing line, and i salute them for their honor and their courage sep my fellow americans, this is a problem which faces us all -- in every city of the north as well as the south sep today, there are negroes unemployed, two or three times as many compared to whites, inadequate education, moving into the large cities, unable to find work, young people particularly out of work without hope, denied equal rights, denied the opportunity to eat at a restaurant or a lunch counter or go to a movie theater, denied the right to a decent education, denied almost today the right to attend a state university even though qualified sep it seems to me that these are matters which concern us all, not merely presidents or congressmen or governors, but every citizen of the united states sep this is one country sep it has become one country because all of us and all the people who came here had an equal chance to develop their talents sep we cannot say to ten percent of the population that you can't have that right; that your children cannot have the chance to develop whatever talents they have; that the only way that they are going to get their rights is to go in the street and demonstrate sep i think we owe them and we owe ourselves a better country than that sep therefore, i'm asking for your help in making it easier for us to move ahead and to provide the kind of equality of treatment which we would want ourselves; to give a chance for every child to be educated to the limit of his talents sep as i've said before, not every child has an equal talent or an equal ability or equal motivation, but they should have the equal right to develop their talent and their ability and their motivation, to make something of themselves sep we have a right to expect that the negro community will be responsible, will uphold the law, but they have a right to expect that the law will be fair, that the constitution will be color blind, as justice harlan said at the turn of the century sep this is what we're talking about and this is a matter which concerns this country and what it stands for, and in meeting it i ask the support of all our citizens sep thank you very much
ESFP	good evening, my fellow citizens: this government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the soviet military buildup on the island of cuba sep within the past week, unmistakable evidence has established the fact that a series of offensive missile sites is now in preparation on that imprisoned island sep the purpose of these bases can be none other than to provide a nuclear strike capability against the western hemisphere sep upon receiving the first preliminary hard information of this nature last tuesday morning at 9 a sep m sep , i directed that our surveillance be stepped up sep and having now confirmed and completed our evaluation of the evidence and our decision on a course of action, this government feels obliged to report this new crisis to you in fullest detail sep the characteristics of these new missile sites indicate two distinct types of installations sep several of them include medium range ballistic missiles, capable of carrying a nuclear warhead for a distance of more than 1,000 nautical miles sep each of these missiles, in short, is capable of striking washington, d sep c sep , the panama canal, cape canaveral, mexico city, or any other city in the southeastern part of the united states, in central america, or in the caribbean area sep additional sites not yet completed appear to be designed for intermediate range ballistic missiles -- capable of traveling more than twice as far -- and thus capable of striking most of the major cities in the western hemisphere, ranging as far north as hudson bay, canada, and as far south as lima, peru sep in addition, jet bombers, capable of carrying nuclear weapons, are now being uncrated and assembled in cuba, while the necessary air bases are being prepared sep this urgent transformation of cuba into an important strategic base -- by the presence of these large, long-range, and clearly offensive weapons of sudden mass destruction -- constitutes an explicit threat to the peace and security of all the americas, in flagrant and deliberate defiance of the rio pact of 1947, the traditions of this nation and hemisphere, the joint resolution of the 87th congress, the charter of the united nations, and my own public warnings to the soviets on september 4 and 13 sep this action also contradicts the repeated assurances of soviet spokesmen, both publicly and privately delivered, that the arms buildup in cuba would retain its original defensive character, and that the soviet union had no need or desire to station strategic missiles sep on the territory of any other nation sep the size of this undertaking makes clear that it has been planned for some months sep yet, only last month, after i had made clear the distinction between any introduction of ground-to-ground missiles and the existence of defensive antiaircraft missiles, the soviet government publicly stated on september 11 that, and i quote, "the armaments and military equipment sent to cuba are designed exclusively for defensive purposes," that there is, and i quote the soviet government, "there is no need for the soviet government to shift its weapons for a retaliatory blow to any other country, for instance cuba," and that, and i quote their government, "the soviet union has so powerful rockets to carry these nuclear warheads that there is no need to search for sites for them beyond the boundaries of the soviet union sep "that statement was false sep only last thursday, as evidence of this rapid offensive buildup was already in my hand, soviet foreign minister gromyko told me in my office that he was instructed to make it clear once again, as he said his government had already done, that soviet assistance to cuba, and i quote, "pursued solely the purpose of contributing to the defense capabilities of cuba," that, and i quote him, "training by soviet specialists of cuban nationals in handling defensive armaments was by no means offensive, and if it were otherwise," mr sep gromyko went on, "the soviet government would never become involved in rendering such assistance sep "that statement also was false sep neither the united states of america nor the world community of nations can tolerate deliberate deception and offensive threats on the part of any nation, large or small sep we no longer live in a world where only the actual firing of weapons represents a sufficient challenge to a nation's security to constitute maximum peril sep nuclear weapons are so destructive and ballistic missiles are so swift, that any substantially increased possibility of their use or any sudden change in their deployment may well be regarded as a definite threat to peace sep for many years, both the soviet union and the united states, recognizing this fact, have deployed strategic nuclear weapons with great care, never upsetting the precarious status quo which insured that these weapons would not be used in the absence of some vital challenge sep our own strategic missiles have never been transferred to the territory of any other nation under a cloak of secrecy and deception; and our history -- unlike that of the soviets since the end of world war ii -- demonstrates that we have no desire to dominate or conquer any other nation or impose our system upon its people sep nevertheless, american citizens have become adjusted to living daily on the bull's-eye of soviet missiles located inside the u sep s sep s sep r sep or in submarines sep in that sense, missiles in cuba add to an already clear and present danger -- although it should be noted the nations of latin america have never previously been subjected to a potential nuclear threat sep but this secret, swift, extraordinary buildup of communist missiles -- in an area well known to have a special and historical relationship to the united states and the nations of the western hemisphere, in violation of soviet assurances, and in defiance of american and hemispheric policy -- this sudden, clandestine decision to station strategic weapons for the first time outside of soviet soil -- is a deliberately provocative and unjustified change in the status quo which cannot be accepted by this country, if our courage and our commitments are ever to be trusted again by either friend or foe sep the 1930's taught us a clear lesson: aggressive conduct, if allowed to go unchecked and unchallenged, ultimately leads to war sep this nation is opposed to war sep we are also true to our word sep our unswerving objective, therefore, must be to prevent the use of these missiles against this or any other country, and to secure their withdrawal or elimination from the western hemisphere sep our policy has been one of patience and restraint, as befits a peaceful and powerful nation which leads a worldwide alliance sep we have been determined not to be diverted from our central concerns by mere irritants and fanatics sep but now further action is required, and it is under way; and these actions may only be the beginning sep we will not prematurely or unnecessarily risk the costs of worldwide nuclear war in which even the fruits of victory would be ashes in our mouth; but neither will we shrink from that risk at any time it must be faced sep acting, therefore, in the defense of our own security and of the entire western hemisphere, and under the authority entrusted to me by the constitution as endorsed by the resolution of the congress, i have directed that the following initial steps be taken immediately: first: to halt this offensive buildup a strict quarantine on all offensive military equipment under shipment to cuba is being initiated sep all ships of any kind bound for cuba from whatever nation or port will, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, be turned back sep this quarantine will be extended, if needed, to other types of cargo and carriers sep we are not at this time, however, denying the necessities of life as the soviets attempted to do in their berlin blockade of 1948 sep second: i have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of cuba and its military buildup sep the foreign ministers of the oas [organization of american states], in their communiqu sep ' of october 6, rejected secrecy on such matters in this hemisphere sep should these offensive military preparations continue, thus increasing the threat to the hemisphere, further action will be justified sep i have directed the armed forces to prepare for any eventualities; and i trust that in the interest of both the cuban people and the soviet technicians at the sites, the hazards to all concerned of continuing this threat will be recognized sep third: it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from cuba against any nation in the western hemisphere as an attack by the soviet union on the united states, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the soviet union sep fourth: as a necessary military precaution, i have reinforced our base at guantanamo, evacuated today the dependents of our personnel there, and ordered additional military units to be on a standby alert basis sep fifth: we are calling tonight for an immediate meeting of the organ[ization] of consultation under the organization of american states, to consider this threat to hemispheric security and to invoke articles 6 and 8 of the rio treaty in support of all necessary action sep the united nations charter allows for regional security arrangements, and the nations of this hemisphere decided long ago against the military presence of outside powers sep our other allies around the world have also been alerted sep sixth: under the charter of the united nations, we are asking tonight that an emergency meeting of the security council be convoked without delay to take action against this latest soviet threat to world peace sep our resolution will call for the prompt dismantling and withdrawal of all offensive weapons in cuba, under the supervision of u sep n sep observers, before the quarantine can be lifted sep seventh and finally: i call upon chairman khrushchev to halt and eliminate this clandestine, reckless, and provocative threat to world peace and to stable relations between our two nations sep i call upon him further to abandon this course of world domination, and to join in an historic effort to end the perilous arms race and to transform the history of man sep he has an opportunity now to move the world back from the abyss of destruction by returning to his government's own words that it had no need to station missiles outside its own territory, and withdrawing these weapons from cuba by refraining from any action which will widen or deepen the present crisis, and then by participating in a search for peaceful and permanent solutions sep this nation is prepared to present its case against the soviet threat to peace, and our own proposals for a peaceful world, at any time and in any forum -- in the oas, in the united nations, or in any other meeting that could be useful -- without limiting our freedom of action sep we have in the past made strenuous efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons sep we have proposed the elimination of all arms and military bases in a fair and effective disarmament treaty sep we are prepared to discuss new proposals for the removal of tensions on both sides, including the possibilities of a genuinely independent cuba, free to determine its own destiny sep we have no wish to war with the soviet union -- for we are a peaceful people who desire to live in peace with all other peoples sep but it is difficult to settle or even discuss these problems in an atmosphere of intimidation sep that is why this latest soviet threat -- or any other threat which is made either independently or in response to our actions this week-- must and will be met with determination sep any hostile move anywhere in the world against the safety and freedom of peoples to whom we are committed, including in particular the brave people of west berlin, will be met by whatever action is needed sep finally, i want to say a few words to the captive people of cuba, to whom this speech is being directly carried by special radio facilities sep i speak to you as a friend, as one who knows of your deep attachment to your fatherland, as one who shares your aspirations for liberty and justice for all sep and i have watched and the american people have watched with deep sorrow how your nationalist revolution was betrayed -- and how your fatherland fell under foreign domination sep now your leaders are no longer cuban leaders inspired by cuban ideals sep they are puppets and agents of an international conspiracy which has turned cuba against your friends and neighbors in the americas, and turned it into the first latin american country to become a target for nuclear war -- the first latin american country to have these weapons on its soil sep these new weapons are not in your interest sep they contribute nothing to your peace and well-being sep they can only undermine it sep but this country has no wish to cause you to suffer or to impose any system upon you sep we know that your lives and land are being used as pawns by those who deny your freedom sep many times in the past, the cuban people have risen to throw out tyrants who destroyed their liberty sep and i have no doubt that most cubans today look forward to the time when they will be truly free -- free from foreign domination, free to choose their own leaders, free to select their own system, free to own their own land, free to speak and write and worship without fear or degradation sep and then shall cuba be welcomed back to the society of free nations and to the associations of this hemisphere sep my fellow citizens, let no one doubt that this is a difficult and dangerous effort on which we have set out sep no one can foresee precisely what course it will take or what costs or casualties will be incurred sep many months of sacrifice and self-discipline lie ahead -- months in which both our patience and our will will be tested, months in which many threats and denunciations will keep us aware of our dangers sep but the greatest danger of all would be to do nothing sep the path we have chosen for the present is full of hazards, as all paths are; but it is the one most consistent with our character and courage as a nation and our commitments around the world sep the cost of freedom is always high, but americans have always paid it sep and one path we shall never choose, and that is the path of surrender or submission sep our goal is not the victory of might, but the vindication of right; not peace at the expense of freedom, but both peace and freedom, here in this hemisphere, and, we hope, around the world sep god willing, that goal will be achieved sep thank you and good night
ISTJ	tonight, we pause and give praise and honor to god for being good enough to allow us to be at this place at this time sep when i look out at this convention, i see the face of america: red, yellow, brown, black and white sep we're all precious in god's sight -- the real rainbow coalition sep all of us -- all of us who are here think that we are seated sep but we're really standing on someone's shoulders sep ladies and gentlemen, mrs sep rosa parks -- the mother of the civil rights movement sep [mrs sep rosa parks is brought to the podium sep ]i want to express my deep love and appreciation for the support my family has given me over these past months sep they have endured pain, anxiety, threat, and fear sep but they have been strengthened and made secure by our faith in god, in america, and in you sep your love has protected us and made us strong sep to my wife jackie, the foundation of our family;

the head of the mississippi freedom democratic party sep but tonight, a black and white delegation from mississippi is headed by ed cole, a black man from mississippi; twenty-four years later sep many were lost in the struggle for the right to vote: jimmy lee jackson, a young student, gave his life; viola liuzzo, a white mother from detroit, called "nigger lover," and brains blown out at point blank range; [michael] schwerner, [andrew] goodman and [james] chaney -- two jews and a black -- found in a common grave, bodies riddled with bullets in mississippi;

a state where governors once stood in school house doors; where julian bond was denied a seat in the state legislature because of his conscientious objection to the vietnam war; a city that, through its five black universities, has graduated more black students than any city in the world sep atlanta, now a modern intersection of the new south sep common ground sep that's the challenge of our party tonight -- left wing, right wing sep progress will not come through boundless liberalism nor static conservatism, but at the critical mass of mutual survival -- not at boundless liberalism nor static conservatism, but at the critical mass of mutual survival sep it takes two wings to fly sep whether you're a hawk or a dove, you're just a bird living in the same environment, in the same world sep the bible teaches that when lions and lambs lie down together, none will be afraid, and there will be peace in the valley sep it sounds impossible sep lions eat lambs sep lambs sensibly flee from lions sep yet even lions and lambs find common ground sep why sep because neither lions nor lambs want the forest to catch on fire sep neither lions nor lambs want acid rain to fall sep neither lions nor lambs can survive nuclear war sep if lions and lambs can find common ground, surely we can as well -- as civilized people sep the only time that we win is when we come together sep in 1960, john kennedy, the late john kennedy, beat richard nixon by only 112,000 votes -- less than one vote per precinct sep he won by the margin of our hope sep he brought us together sep he reached out sep he had the courage to defy his advisors and inquire about dr sep king's jailing in albany, georgia sep we won by the margin of our hope, inspired by courageous leadership sep in 1964, lyndon johnson brought both wings together -- the thesis, the antithesis, and the creative synthesis -- and together we won sep in 1976, jimmy carter unified us again, and we won sep when do we not come together, we never win sep in 1968, the division and despair in july led to our defeat in november sep in 1980, rancor in the spring and the summer led to reagan in the fall sep when we divide, we cannot win sep we must find common ground as the basis for survival and development and change and growth sep today when we debated, differed, deliberated, agreed to agree, agreed to disagree, when we had the good judgment to argue a case and then not self-destruct, george bush was just a little further away from the white house and a little closer to private life sep tonight, i salute governor michael dukakis sep he has run -- he has run a well-managed and a dignified campaign sep no matter how tired or how tried, he always resisted the temptation to stoop to demagoguery sep i've watched a good mind fast at work, with steel nerves, guiding his campaign out of the crowded field without appeal to the worst in us sep i've watched his perspective grow as his environment has expanded sep i've seen his toughness and tenacity close up sep i know his commitment to public service sep mike dukakis' parents were a doctor and a teacher;

ESTJ	president hatcher, governor romney, senators mcnamara and hart, congressmen meader and staebler, and other members of the fine michigan delegation, members of the graduating class, my fellow americans: it is a great pleasure to be here today sep this university has been coeducational since 1870, but i do not believe it was on the basis of your accomplishments that a detroit high school girl said (and i quote), "in choosing a college, you first have to decide whether you want a coeducational school or an educational school sep " well, we can find both here at michigan, although perhaps at different hours sep i came out here today very anxious to meet the michigan student whose father told a friend of mine that his son's education had been a real value sep it stopped his mother from bragging about him sep i have come today from the turmoil of your capital to the tranquility of your campus to speak about the future of your country sep the purpose of protecting the life of our nation and preserving the liberty of our citizens is to pursue the happiness of our people sep our success in that pursuit is the test of our success as a nation sep for a century we labored to settle and to subdue a continent sep for half a century we called upon unbounded invention and untiring industry to create an order of plenty for all of our people sep the challenge of the next half century is whether we have the wisdom to use that wealth to enrich and elevate our national life, and to advance the quality of our american civilization sep your imagination and your initiative and your indignation will determine whether we build a society where progress is the servant of our needs, or a society where old values and new visions are buried under unbridled growth sep for in your time we have the opportunity to move not only toward the rich society and the powerful society, but upward to the great society sep the great society rests on abundance and liberty for all sep it demands an end to poverty and racial injustice, to which we are totally committed in our time sep but that is just the beginning sep the great society is a place where every child can find knowledge to enrich his mind and to enlarge his talents sep it is a place where leisure is a welcome chance to build and reflect, not a feared cause of boredom and restlessness sep it is a place where the city of man serves not only the needs of the body and the demands of commerce but the desire for beauty and the hunger for community sep it is a place where man can renew contact with nature sep it is a place which honors creation for its own sake and for what is adds to the understanding of the race sep it is a place where men are more concerned with the quality of their goals than the quantity of their goods sep but most of all, the great society is not a safe harbor, a resting place, a final objective, a finished work sep it is a challenge constantly renewed, beckoning us toward a destiny where the meaning of our lives matches the marvelous products of our labor sep so i want to talk to you today about three places where we begin to build the great society -- in our cities, in our countryside, and in our classrooms sep many of you will live to see the day, perhaps 50 years from now, when there will be 400 million americans -- four-fifths of them in urban areas sep in the remainder of this century urban population will double, city land will double, and we will have to build homes and highways and facilities equal to all those built since this country was first settled sep so in the next 40 years we must re-build the entire urban united states sep aristotle said: "men come together in cities in order to live, but they remain together in order to live the good life sep " it is harder and harder to live the good life in american cities today sep the catalog of ills is long: there is the decay of the centers and the despoiling of the suburbs sep there is not enough housing for our people or transportation for our traffic sep open land is vanishing and old landmarks are violated sep worst of all expansion is eroding these precious and time honored values of community with neighbors and communion with nature sep the loss of these values breeds loneliness and boredom and indifference sep and our society will never be great until our cities are great sep today the frontier of imagination and innovation is inside those cities and not beyond their borders sep new experiments are already going on sep it will be the task of your generation to make the american city a place where future generations will come, not only to live, but to live the good life sep and i understand that if i stayed here tonight i would see that michigan students are really doing their best to live the good life sep this is the place where the peace corps was started sep it is inspiring to see how all of you, while you are in this country, are trying so hard to live at the level of the people sep a second place where we begin to build the great society is in our countryside sep we have always prided ourselves on being not only america the strong and america the free, but america the beautiful sep today that beauty is in danger sep the water we drink, the food we eat, the very air that we breathe, are threatened with pollution sep our parks are overcrowded, our seashores overburdened sep green fields and dense forests are disappearing sep a few years ago we were greatly concerned about the "ugly american sep " today we must act to prevent an ugly america sep for once the battle is lost, once our natural splendor is destroyed, it can never be recaptured sep and once man can no longer walk with beauty or wonder at nature his spirit will wither and his sustenance be wasted sep a third place to build the great society is in the classrooms of america sep there your children's lives will be shaped sep our society will not be great until every young mind is set free to scan the farthest reaches of thought and imagination sep we are still far from that goal sep today, 8 million adult americans, more than the entire population of michigan, have not finished 5 years of school sep nearly 20 million have not finished 8 years of school sep nearly 54 million -- more than one quarter of all america -- have not even finished high school sep each year more than 100,000 high school graduates, with proved ability, do not enter college because they cannot afford it sep and if we cannot educate today's youth, what will we do in 1970 when elementary school enrollment will be 5 million greater than 1960 sep and high school enrollment will rise by 5 million sep and college enrollment will increase by more than 3 million sep in many places, classrooms are overcrowded and curricula are outdated sep most of our qualified teachers are underpaid and many of our paid teachers are unqualified sep so we must give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from sep poverty must not be a bar to learning, and learning must offer an escape from poverty sep but more classrooms and more teachers are not enough sep we must seek an educational system which grows in excellence as it grows in size sep this means better training for our teachers sep it means preparing youth to enjoy their hours of leisure as well as their hours of labor sep it means exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation sep these are three of the central issues of the great society sep while our government has many programs directed at those issues, i do not pretend that we have the full answer to those problems sep but i do promise this: we are going to assemble the best thought and the broadest knowledge from all over the world to find those answers for america sep i intend to establish working groups to prepare a series of white house conferences and meetings -- on the cities, on natural beauty, on the quality of education, and on other emerging challenges sep and from these meetings and from this inspiration and from these studies we will begin to set our course toward the great society sep the solution to these problems does not rest on a massive program in washington, nor can it rely solely on the strained resources of local authority sep they require us to create new concepts of cooperation, a creative federalism, between the national capital and the leaders of local communities sep woodrow wilson once wrote: "every man sent out from his university should be a man of his nation as well as a man of his time sep "within your lifetime powerful forces, already loosed, will take us toward a way of life beyond the realm of our experience, almost beyond the bounds of our imagination sep for better or for worse, your generation has been appointed by history to deal with those problems and to lead america toward a new age sep you have the chance never before afforded to any people in any age sep you can help build a society where the demands of morality, and the needs of the spirit, can be realized in the life of the nation sep so, will you join in the battle to give every citizen the full equality which god enjoins and the law requires, whatever his belief, or race, or the color of his skin sep will you join in the battle to give every citizen an escape from the crushing weight of poverty sep will you join in the battle to make it possible for all nations to live in enduring peace -- as neighbors and not as mortal enemies sep will you join in the battle to build the great society, to prove that our material progress is only the foundation on which we will build a richer life of mind and spirit sep there are those timid souls that say this battle cannot be won; that we are condemned to a soulless wealth sep i do not agree sep we have the power to shape the civilization that we want sep but we need your will and your labor and your hearts, if we are to build that kind of society sep those who came to this land sought to build more than just a new country sep they sought a new world sep so i have come here today to your campus to say that you can make their vision our reality sep so let us from this moment begin our work so that in the future men will look back and say: it was then, after a long and weary way, that man turned the exploits of his genius to the full enrichment of his life sep thank you sep good-bye
ESTP	thank you very much professor kombay for that generous introduction sep and let me say, that i never expected to hear such kind words from dr sep falwell sep so in return, i have an invitation of my own sep on january 20th, 1985, i hope dr sep falwell will say a prayer at the inauguration of the next democratic president of the united states sep now, dr sep falwell, im not exactly sure how you feel about that sep you might not appreciate the president, but the democrats certainly would appreciate the prayer sep actually, a number of people in washington were surprised that i was invited to speak here -- and even more surprised when i accepted the invitation sep they seem to think that its easier for a camel to pass through the eye of the needle than for a kennedy to come to the campus of liberty baptist college sep in honor of our meeting, i have asked dr sep falwell, as your chancellor, to permit all the students an extra hour next saturday night before curfew sep and in return, i have promised to watch the old time gospel hour next sunday morning sep i realize that my visit may be a little controversial sep but as many of you have heard, dr sep falwell recently sent me a membership in the moral majority -- and i didn't even apply for it sep and i wonder if that means that i'm a member in good standing sep [falwell: somewhat]somewhat, he says sep this is, of course, a nonpolitical speech which is probably best under the circumstances sep since i am not a candidate for president, it would certainly be inappropriate to ask for your support in this election and probably inaccurate to thank you for it in the last one sep i have come here to discuss my beliefs about faith and country, tolerance and truth in america sep i know we begin with certain disagreements; and i strongly suspect that at the end of the evening some of our disagreements will remain sep but i also hope that tonight and in the months and years ahead, we will always respect the right of others to differ, that we will never lose sight of our own fallibility, and that we will view ourselves with a sense of perspective and a sense of humor sep after all, in the new testament, even the disciples had to be taught to look first to the beam in their own eyes, and only then to the mote in their neighbors e"s sep i am mindful of that counsel sep i am an american and a catholic; i love my country and treasure my faith sep but i do not assume that my conception of patriotism or policy is invariably correct, or that my convictions about religion should command any greater respect than any other faith in this pluralistic society sep i believe there surely is such a thing as truth, but who among us can claim a monopoly on it sep there are those who do, and their own words testify to their intolerance sep for example, because the moral majority has worked with members of different denominations, one fundamentalist group has denounced dr sep falwell for hastening the ecumenical church and for "yoking together with roman catholics, mormons, and others sep " i am relieved that dr sep falwell does not regard that as a sin, and on this issue, he himself has become the target of narrow prejudice sep when people agree on public policy, they ought to be able to work together, even while they worship in diverse ways sep for truly we are all yoked together as americans, and the yoke is the happy one of individual freedom and mutual respect sep but in saying that, we cannot and should not turn aside from a deeper and more pressing question -- which is whether and how religion should influence government sep a generation ago, a presidential candidate had to prove his independence of undue religious influence in public life, and he had to do so partly at the insistence of evangelical protestants sep john kennedy said at that time: i believe in an america where there is no religious bloc voting of any kind sep  only twenty years later, another candidate was appealing to a[n] evangelical meeting as a religious bloc sep ronald reagan said to 15 thousand evangelicals at the roundtable in dallas:  i know that you cant endorse me sep i want you to know i endorse you and what you are doing sep to many americans, that pledge was a sign and a symbol of a dangerous breakdown in the separation of church and state sep yet this principle, as vital as it is, is not a simplistic and rigid command sep separation of church and state cannot mean an absolute separation between moral principles and political power sep the challenge today is to recall the origin of the principle, to define its purpose, and refine its application to the politics of the present sep the founders of our nation had long and bitter experience with the state, as both the agent and the adversary of particular religious views sep in colonial maryland, catholics paid a double land tax, and in pennsylvania they had to list their names on a public roll -- an ominous precursor of the first nazi laws against the jews sep and jews in turn faced discrimination in all of the thirteen original colonies sep massachusetts exiled roger williams and his congregation for contending that civil government had no right to enforce the ten commandments sep virginia harassed baptist teachers, and also established a religious test for public service, writing into the law that no popish followers could hold any office sep but during the revolution, catholics, jews, and non-conformists all rallied to the cause and fought valiantly for the american commonwealth -- for john winthrops city upon a hill sep  afterwards, when the constitution was ratified and then amended, the framers gave freedom for all religion, and from any established religion, the very first place in the bill of rights sep indeed the framers themselves professed very different faiths: washington was an episcopalian, jefferson a deist, and adams a calvinist sep and although he had earlier opposed toleration, john adams later contributed to the building of catholic churches, and so did george washington sep thomas jefferson said his proudest achievement was not the presidency, or the writing the declaration of independence, but drafting the virginia statute of religious freedom sep he stated the vision of the first americans and the first amendment very clearly: the god who gave us life gave us liberty at the same time sep the separation of church and state can sometimes be frustrating for women and men of religious faith sep they may be tempted to misuse government in order to impose a value which they cannot persuade others to accept sep but once we succumb to that temptation, we step onto a slippery slope where everyones freedom is at risk sep those who favor censorship should recall that one of the first books ever burned was the first english translation of the bible sep as president eisenhower warned in 1953, dont join the book burners sep sep sep the right to say ideas, the right to record them, and the right to have them accessible to others is unquestioned -- or this isnt america sep and if that right is denied, at some future"he torch can be turned against any other book or any other belief sep let us never forget: todays moral majority could become tomorrows persecuted minority sep the danger is as great now as when the founders of the nation first saw it sep in 1789, their fear was of factional strife among dozens of denominations sep today there are hundreds -- and perhaps even thousands of faiths -- and millions of americans who are outside any fold sep pluralism obviously does not and cannot mean that all of them are right; but it does mean that there are areas where government cannot and should not decide what is wrong to believe, to think, to read, and to do sep as professor larry tribe, one of the nations leading constitutional scholars has written, law in a non-theocratic state cannot measure religious truth, nor can the state impose it sep "e real transgression occurs when religion wants government to tell citizens how to live uniquely personal parts of their lives sep the failure of prohibition proves the futility of such an attempt when a majority or even a substantial minority happens to disagree sep some questions may be inherently individual ones, or people may be sharply divided about whether they are sep in such cases, like prohibition and abortion, the proper role of religion is to appeal to the conscience of the individual, not the coercive power of the state sep but there are other questions which are inherently public in nature, which we must decide together as a nation, and where religion and religious values can and should speak to our common conscience sep the issue of nuclear war is a compelling example sep it is a moral issue; it will be decided by government, not by each individual; and to give any effect to the moral values of their creed, people of faith must speak directly about public policy sep the catholic bishops and the reverend billy graham have every right to stand for the nuclear freeze, and dr sep falwell has every right to stand against it sep there must be standards for the exercise of such leadership, so that the obligations of belief will not be debased into an opportunity for mere political advantage sep but to take a stand at all when a question is both properly public and truly moral is to stand in a long and honored tradition sep many of the great evangelists of the 1800s were in the forefront of the abolitionist movement sep in our own time, the reverend william sloane coffin challenged the morality of the war in vietnam sep pope john xxiii renewed the gospels call to social justice sep and dr sep martin luther king, jr sep who was the greatest prophet of this century, awakened our nation and its conscience to the evil of racial segregation sep their words have blessed our world sep and who now wishes they had been silent sep who would bid pope john paul [ii] to quiet his voice against the oppression in eastern europe, the violence in central america, or the crying needs of the landless, the hungry, and those who are tortured in so many of the dark political prisons of our time sep president kennedy, who said that no religious body should seek to impose its will, also urged religious leaders to state their views and give their commitment when the public debate involved ethical issues sep in drawing the line between imposed will and essential witness, we keep church and state separate, and at the same time we recognize that the city of god should speak to the civic duties of men and w" sep there are four tests which draw that line and define the difference sep first, we must respect the integrity of religion itself sep people of conscience should be careful how they deal in the word of their lord sep in our own history, religion has been falsely invoked to sanction prejudice -- even slavery -- to condemn labor unions and public spending for the poor sep i believe that the prophecy, "the poor you always have with you" is an indictment, not a commandment sep and i respectfully suggest that god has taken no position on the department of education -- and that a balanced budget constitutional amendment is a matter of economic analysis, and not heavenly appeals sep religious values cannot be excluded from every public issue; but not every public issue involves religious values sep and how ironic it is when those very values are denied in the name of religion sep for example, we are sometimes told that it is wrong to feed the hungry, but that mission is an explicit mandate given to us in the 25th chapter of matthew sep second, we must respect the independent judgments of conscience sep those who proclaim moral and religious values can offer counsel, but they should not casually treat a position on a public issue as a test of fealty to faith sep just as i disagree with the catholic bishops on tuition tax credits -- which i oppose -- so other catholics can and do disagree with the hierarchy, on the basis of honest conviction, on the question of the nuclear freeze sep thus, the controversy about the moral majority arises not only from its views, but from its name -- which, in the minds of many, seems to imply that only one set of public policies is moral and only one majority can possibly be right sep similarly, people are and should be perplexed when the religious lobbying group christian voice publishes a morality index of congressional voting records, which judges the morality of senators by their attitude toward zimbabwe and taiwan sep let me offer another illustration sep dr sep falwell has written -- and i quote: to stand against israel is to stand against god sep  now there is no one in the senate who has stood more firmly for israel than i have sep yet, i do not doubt the faith of those on the other side sep their error is not one of religion, but of policy sep and i hope to be able to persuade them that -- that they are wrong in terms of both americas interest and the justice of israels cause sep respect for conscience is most in jeopardy, and the harmony of our diverse society is most at risk, when we re-establish, directly or indirectly, a religious test for public office sep that relic of the colonial era, which is specifically prohibited in the constitution, has reappeared in recent years sep after the last election, the reverend james robison -- robison warned president reagan no to surround himself, as president before him had, with the counsel of the ungodly sep i utterly reject any such standard for any position anywhere in public service sep two centuries ago, the victims were catholics and jews sep in the 1980s the victims could be atheists; in some other day or decade, they could be the members of the thomas road baptist church sep indeed, in 1976 i regarded it as unworthy and un-american when some people said or hinted that jimmy carter should not be president because he was a born again christian sep we must never judge the fitness of individuals to govern on the bas[is] of where they worship, whether they follow christ or moses, whether they are called born again or ungodly sep  where it is right to apply moral values to public life, let all of us avoid the temptation to be self-righteous and absolutely certain of ourselves sep and if that temptation ever comes, let us recall winston churchills humbling description of an intolerant and inflexible colleague: there but for the grace of god goes god sep third, in applying religious values, we must respect the integrity of public debate sep in that debate, faith is no substitute for facts sep critics may oppose the nuclear freeze for what they regard as moral reasons sep they have every right to argue that any negotiation with the soviets is wrong, or that any accommodation with them sanctions their crimes, or that no agreement can be good enough and therefore all agreements only increase the chance of war sep i do not believe that, but it surely does not violate the standard of fair public debate to say it sep what does violate that standard, what the opponents of the nuclear freeze have no right to do, is to assume that they are infallible, and so any argument against the freeze will do, whether it is false or true sep the nuclear freeze proposal is not unilateral, but bilateral -- with equal restraints on the united states and the soviet union sep the nuclear freeze does not require that we trust the russians, but demands full and effective verification sep the nuclear freeze does not concede a soviet lead in nuclear weapons, but recognizes that human beings in each great power already have in their fallible hands the overwhelming capacity to remake into a pile of radioactive rubble the earth which god has made sep there is no morality -- there is no morality in the mushroom cloud sep the black rain of nuclear ashes will fall alike on the just and the unjust sep and then it will be too late to wish that we had done the real work of this atomic age -- which is to seek a world that is neither red nor dead sep i am perfectly prepared to debate the nuclear freeze on policy grounds, or moral ones sep but we should not be forced to discuss phantom issues or false charges sep they only deflect us form the urgent task of deciding how best to prevent a planet divided from becoming a planet destroyed sep and it does not advance the debate to contend that the arms race is more divine punishment than human problem, or that in any event, the final days are near sep as pope john said two decades ago, at the opening of the second vatican council: we must beware of those who burn with zeal, but are not endowed with much sense sep sep sep we must disagree with the prophets of doom, who are always forecasting disasters, as though the end of the earth was at hand sep the message which echoes across the years is very clear: the earth is still here; and if we wish to keep it, a prophecy of doom is no alternative to a policy of arms control sep fourth, and finally, we must respect the motives of those who exercise their right to disagree sep we sorely test our ability to live together if we readily question each others integrity sep it may be harder to restrain our feelings when moral principles are at stake, for they go to the deepest wellsprings of our being sep but the more our feelings diverge, the more deeply felt they " the greater is our obligation to grant the sincerity and essential decency of our fellow citizens on the other side sep those who favor e sep r sep a [equal rights amendment] are not antifamily or blasphemers sep and their purpose is not an attack on the bible sep rather, we believe this is the best way to fix in our national firmament the ideal that not only all men, but all people are created equal sep indeed, my mother, who strongly favors e sep r sep a sep , would be surprised to hear that she is anti-family sep for my part, i think of the amendments
INFJ	i have come this evening to talk with you on one of the greatest issues of our time -- that is the preservation of human freedom sep i have chosen to discuss it here in france, at the sorbonne, because here in this soil the roots of human freedom have long ago struck deep and here they have been richly nourished sep it was here the declaration of the rights of man was proclaimed, and the great slogans of the french revolution -- liberty, equality, fraternity -- fired the imagination of men sep i have chosen to discuss this issue in europe because this has been the scene of the greatest historic battles between freedom and tyranny sep i have chosen to discuss it in the early days of the general assembly because the issue of human liberty is decisive for the settlement of outstanding political differences and for the future of the united nations sep the decisive importance of this issue was fully recognized by the founders of the united nations at san francisco sep concern for the preservation and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms stands at the heart of the united nations sep its charter is distinguished by its preoccupation with the rights and welfare of individual men and women sep the united nations has made it clear that it intends to uphold human rights and to protect the dignity of the human personality sep in the preamble to the charter the keynote is set when it declares: "we the people of the united nations determined sep sep sep to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women and of nations large and small, and sep sep sep to promote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom sep " this reflects the basic premise of the charter that the peace and security of mankind are dependent on mutual respect for the rights and freedoms of all sep one of the purposes of the united nations is declared in article 1 to be: "to achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic, social, cultural, or humanitarian character, and in promoting and encouraging respect for human rights and for fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion sep "this thought is repeated at several points and notably in articles 55 and 56 the members pledge themselves to take joint and separate action in cooperation with the united nations for the promotion of "universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion sep "the human rights commission was given as its first and most important task the preparation of an international bill of rights sep the general assembly, which opened its third session here in paris a few days ago, will have before it the first fruit of the commission's labors in this task, that is the international declaration of human rights sep the declaration was finally completed after much work during the last session of the human rights commission in new york in the spring of 1948 sep the economic and social council has sent it without recommendation to the general assembly, together with other documents transmitted by the human rights commission sep it was decided in our commission that a bill of rights should contain two parts: 1 sep a declaration which could be approved through action of the member states of the united nations in the general assembly sep this declaration would have great moral force, and would say to the peoples of the world "this is what we hope human rights may mean to all people in the years to come sep " we have put down here the rights that we consider basic for individual human beings the world over to have sep without them, we feel that the full development of individual personality is impossible sep 2 sep the second part of the bill, which the human rights commission has not yet completed because of the lack of time, is a covenant which would be in the form of a treaty to be presented to the nations of the world sep each nation, as it is prepared to do so, would ratify this covenant and the covenant would then become binding on the nations which adhere to it sep each nation ratifying would then be obligated to change its laws wherever they did not conform to the points contained in the covenant sep this covenant, of course, would have to be a simpler document sep it could not state aspirations, which we feel to be permissible in the declaration sep it could only state rights which could be assured by law and it must contain methods of implementation, and no state ratifying the covenant could be allowed to disregard it sep the methods of implementation have not yet been agreed upon, nor have they been given adequate consideration by the commission at any of its meetings sep there certainly should be discussion on the entire question of this world bill of human rights and there may be acceptance by this assembly of the declaration if they come to agreement on it sep the acceptance of the declaration, i think, should encourage every nation in the coming months to discuss its meaning with its people so that they will be better prepared to accept the covenant with a deeper understanding of the problems involved when that is presented, we hope, a year from now and, we hope, accepted sep the declaration has come from the human rights commission with unanimous acceptance except for four abstentions -- the u sep s sep s sep r sep , yugoslavia, ukraine, and byelorussia sep the reason for this is a fundamental difference in the conception of human rights as they exist in these states and in certain other member states in the united nations sep in the discussion before the assembly, i think it should be made crystal clear what these differences are and tonight i want to spend a little time making them clear to you sep it seems to me there is a valid reason for taking the time today to think carefully and clearly on the subject of human rights, because in the acceptance and observance of these rights lies the root, i believe, of our chance of peace in the future, and for the strengthening of the united nations organization to the point where it can maintain peace in the future sep we must not be confused about what freedom is sep basic human rights are simple and easily understood: freedom of speech and a free press; freedom of religion and worship; freedom of assembly and the right of petition; the right of men to be secure in their homes and free from unreasonable search and seizure and from arbitrary arrest and punishment sep we must not be deluded by the efforts of the forces of reaction to prostitute the great words of our free tradition and thereby to confuse the struggle sep democracy, freedom, human rights have come to have a definite meaning to the people of the world which we must not allow any nation to so change that they are made synonymous with suppression and dictatorship sep there are basic differences that show up even in the use of words between a democratic and a totalitarian country sep for instance "democracy" means one thing to the u sep s sep s sep r sep and another the u sep s sep a sep and, i know, in france sep i have served since the first meeting of the nuclear commission on the human rights commission, and i think this point stands out clearly sep the u sep s sep s sep r sep representatives assert that they already have achieved many things which we, in what they call the "bourgeois democracies" cannot achieve because their government controls the accomplishment of these things sep our government seems powerless to them because, in the last analysis, it is controlled by the people sep they would not put it that way -- they would say that the people in the u sep s sep s sep r sep control their government by allowing their government to have certain absolute rights sep we, on the other hand, feel that certain rights can never be granted to the government, but must be kept in the hands of the people sep for instance, the u sep s sep s sep r sep will assert that their press is free because the state makes it free by providing the machinery, the paper, and even the money for salaries for the people who work on the paper sep they state that there is no control over what is printed in the various papers that they subsidize in this manner, such, for instance, as a trade-union paper sep but what would happen if a paper were to print ideas which were critical of the basic policies and beliefs of the communist government sep sep i am sure some good reason would be found for abolishing the paper sep it is true that they have been many cases where newspapers in the u sep s sep s sep r sep have criticized officials and their actions and have been responsible for the removal of those officials, but in doing so they did not criticize anything which was fundamental to communist beliefs sep they simply criticized methods of doing things, so one must differentiate between things which are permissible, such as criticism of any individual or of the manner of doing things, and the criticism of a belief which would be considered vital to the acceptance of communism sep what are the differences, for instance, between trade-unions in the totalitarian states and in the democracies sep in the totalitarian state a trade-union is an instrument used by the government to enforce duties, not to assert rights sep propaganda material which the government desires the workers to have is furnished by the trade-unions to be circulated to their members sep our trade-unions, on the other hand, are solely the instrument of the workers themselves sep they represent the workers in their relations with the government and with management and they are free to develop their own opinions without government help or interference sep the concepts of our trade-unions and those in totalitarian countries are drastically different sep there is little mutual understanding sep i think the best example one can give of this basic difference of the use of terms is the right to work sep  the soviet union insists that this is a basic right which it alone can guarantee because it alone provides full employment by the government sep but the right to work in the soviet union means the assignment of workers to do whatever task is given to them by the government without an opportunity for the people to participate in the decision that the government should do this sep a society in which everyone works is not necessarily a free society and may indeed be a slave society; on the other hand, a society in which there is widespread economic insecurity can turn freedom into a barren and vapid right for millions of people sep we in the united states have come to realize it means freedom to choose ones job, to work or not to work as one desires sep we, in the united states, have come to realize, however, that people have a right to demand that their government will not allow them to starve because as individuals they cannot find work of the kind they are accustomed to doing and this is a decision brought about by public opinion which came as a result of the great depression in which many people were out of work, but we would not consider in the united states that we had gained any freedom if we were compelled to follow a dictatorial assignment to work where and when we were told sep the right of choice would seem to us an important, fundamental freedom sep i have great sympathy with the russian people sep they love their country and have always defended it valiantly against invaders sep they have been through a period of revolution, as a result of which they were for a time cut off from outside contact sep they have not lost their resulting suspicion of other countries and the great difficulty is today that their government encourages this suspicion and seems to believe that force alone will bring them respect sep we, in the democracies, believe in a kind of international respect and action which is reciprocal sep we do not think others should treat us differently from the way they wish to be treated sep it is interference in other countries that especially stirs up antagonism against the soviet government sep if it wishes to feel secure in developing its economic and political theories within its territory, then it should grant to others that same security sep we believe in the freedom of people to make their own mistakes sep we do not interfere with them and they should not interfere with others sep the basic problem confronting the world today, as i said in the beginning, is the preservation of human freedom for the individual and consequently for the society of which he is a part sep we are fighting this battle again today as it was fought at the time of the french revolution and as the time of the american revolution sep the issue of human liberty is as decisive now as it was then sep i want to give you my conception of what is meant in my country by freedom of the individual sep long ago in london during a discussion with mr sep vyshinsky, he told me there was no such thing as freedom for the individual in the world sep all freedom of the individual was conditioned by the rights of other individuals sep that of course, i granted sep i said: we approach the question from a different point of view/ we here in the united nations are trying to develop ideals which will be broader in outlook, which will consider first the rights of man, which will consider what makes man more free; not governments, but man sep the totalitarian state typically places the will of the people second to decrees promulgated by a few men at the top sep naturally there must always be consideration of the rights of others; but in a democracy this is not a restriction sep indeed, in our democracies we make our freedoms secure because each of us is expected to respect the rights of others and we are free to make our own laws sep freedom for our peoples is not only a right, but also a tool sep freedom of speech, freedom of the press, freedom of information, freedom of assembly -- these are not just abstract ideals to us; they are tools with which we create a way of life, a way of life in which we can enjoy freedom sep sometimes the processes of democracy are slow, and i have known some of our leaders to say that a benevolent dictatorship would accomplish the ends desired in a much shorter time than it takes to go through the democratic processes of discussion and the slow formation of public opinion sep but there is no way of insuring that a dictatorship will remain benevolent or that power once in the hands of a few will be returned to the people without struggle or revolution sep this we have learned by experience and we accept the slow processes of democracy because we know that shortcuts compromise principles on which no compromise is possible sep the final expression of the opinion of the people with us is through free and honest elections, with valid choices on basic issues and candidates sep the secret ballot is an essential to free elections but you must have a choice before you sep i have heard my husband say many times that a people need never lose their freedom if they kept their right to a secret ballot and if they used that secret ballot to the full sep basic decisions of our society are made through the expressed will of the people sep that is why when we see these liberties threatened, instead of falling apart, our nation becomes unified and our democracies come together as a unified group in spite of our varied backgrounds and many racial strains sep in the united states we have a capitalistic economy sep that is because public opinion favors that type of economy under the conditions in which we live sep but we have imposed certain restraints; for instance, we have antitrust laws sep these are the legal evidence of the determination of the american people to maintain an economy of free competition and not to allow monopolies to take away the peoples freedom sep our trade-unions grow stronger because the people come to believe that this is the proper way to guarantee the rights of the workers and that the right to organize and to bargain collectively keeps the balance between the actual producer an the investor of money and the manage in industry who watches over the man who works with this hands and who produces the materials which are out tangible wealth sep in the united states we are old enough not to claim perfection sep we recognize that we have some problems of discrimination but we find steady progress being made in the solution of these problems sep through normal democratic processes we are coming to understand our needs and how we can attain full equality for all our people sep free discussion on the subject is permitted sep our supreme court has recently rendered decisions to clarify a number of our laws to guarantee the rights of all sep the u sep s sep s sep r sep claims it has reached a point where all races within her borders are officially considered equal and have equal rights and they insist that they have no discrimination where minorities are concerned sep this is a laudable objective but there are other aspects of the development of freedom for the individual which are essential before the mere absence of discrimination is worth much, and these are lacking in the soviet union sep unless they are being denied freedoms which they want and which they see other people have, people do not usually complain of discrimination sep it is these other freedoms -- the basic freedoms of speech, of the press, of religion and conscience, of assembly, of fair trial and freedom from arbitrary arrest and punishment, which a totalitarian government cannot safely give its people and which give meaning to freedom from discrimination sep it is my belief, and i am sure it is also yours, that the struggle for democracy and freedom is a critical struggle, for their preservation is essential to the great objective of the united nations to maintain international peace and security sep among free men the end cannot justify the means sep we know the patterns of totalitarianism -- the single political party, the control of schools, press, radio, the arts, the sciences, and the church to support autocratic authority; these are the age-old patterns against which men have struggled for three thousand years sep these are the signs of reaction, retreat, and retrogression sep the united nations must hold fast to the heritage of freedom won by the struggle of its people; it must help us to pass it on to generations to come sep the development of the ideal of freedom and its translation into the everyday life of the people in great areas of the earth is the product of the efforts of many peoples sep it is the fruit of a long tradition of vigorous thinking and courageous action sep no one race and on one people can claim to have done all the work to achieve greater dignity for human beings and great freedom to develop human personality sep in each generation and in each country there must be a continuation of the struggle and new steps forward must be taken since this is preeminently a field in which to stand still is to retreat sep the field of human rights is not one in which compromise on fundamental principles are possible sep the work of the commission on human rights is illustrative sep the declaration of human rights provides: everyone has the right to leave any country, including his own sep  the soviet representative said he would agree to this right if a single phrase was added to it -- in accordance with the procedure laid down in the laws of that country sep  it is obvious that to accept this would be not only to compromise but to nullify the right stated sep this case forcefully illustrates the importance of the proposition that we must ever be alert not to compromise fundamental human rights merely for the sake of reaching unanimity and thus lose them sep as i see it, it is not going to be easy to attain unanimity with respect to our different concepts of government and human rights sep the struggle is bound to be difficult and one in which we must be firm but patient sep if we adhere faithfully to our principles i think it is possible for us to maintain freedom and to do so peacefully and without recourse to force sep the future must see the broadening of human rights throughout the world sep people who have glimpsed freedom will never be content until they have secured it for themselves sep in a truest sense, human rights are a fundamental object of law and government in a just society sep human rights exist to the degree that they are respected by people in relations with each other and by governments in relations with their citizens sep the world at large is aware of the tragic consequences for human beings ruled by totalitarian systems sep if we examine hitlers rise to power, we see how the chain
ESFP	we're here to mark that day in history when the allied armies joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty sep for four long years, much of europe had been under a terrible shadow sep free nations had fallen, jews cried out in the camps, millions cried out for liberation sep europe was enslaved and the world prayed for its rescue sep here, in normandy, the rescue began sep here, the allies stood and fought against tyranny, in a giant undertaking unparalleled in human history sep we stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of france sep the air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon sep at dawn, on the morning of the 6th of june, 1944, two hundred and twenty-five rangers jumped off the british landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs sep their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out the enemy guns sep the allies had been told that some of the mightiest of these guns were here, and they would be trained on the beaches to stop the allied advance sep the rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers at the edge of the cliffs, shooting down at them with machine guns and throwing grenades sep and the american rangers began to climb sep they shot rope ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves up sep when one ranger fell, another would take his place sep when one rope was cut, a ranger would grab another and begin his climb again sep they climbed, shot back, and held their footing sep soon, one by one, the rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to seize back the continent of europe sep two hundred and twenty-five came here sep after two days of fighting, only ninety could still bear arms sep and behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the ranger daggers that were thrust into the top of these cliffs sep and before me are the men who put them there sep these are the boys of pointe du hoc sep these are the men who took the cliffs sep these are the champions who helped free a continent sep and these are the heroes who helped end a war sep gentlemen, i look at you and i think of the words of stephen spender's poem sep you are men who in your "lives fought for life and left the vivid air signed with your honor sep "i think i know what you may be thinking right now -- thinking "we were just part of a bigger effort; everyone was brave that day sep " well everyone was sep do you remember the story of bill millin of the 51st highlanders sep forty years ago today, british troops were pinned down near a bridge, waiting desperately for help sep suddenly, they heard the sound of bagpipes, and some thought they were dreaming sep well, they weren't sep they looked up and saw bill millin with his bagpipes, leading the reinforcements and ignoring the smack of the bullets into the ground around him sep lord lovat was with him -- lord lovat of scotland, who calmly announced when he got to the bridge, "sorry, i'm a few minutes late," as if he'd been delayed by a traffic jam, when in truth he'd just come from the bloody fighting on sword beach, which he and his men had just taken sep there was the impossible valor of the poles, who threw themselves between the enemy and the rest of europe as the invasion took hold; and the unsurpassed courage of the canadians who had already seen the horrors of war on this coast sep they knew what awaited them there, but they would not be deterred sep and once they hit juno beach, they never looked back sep all of these men were part of a roll call of honor with names that spoke of a pride as bright as the colors they bore; the royal winnipeg rifles, poland's 24th lancers, the royal scots' fusiliers, the screaming eagles, the yeomen of england's armored divisions, the forces of free france, the coast guard's "matchbox fleet," and you, the american rangers sep forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here sep you were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you sep yet you risked everything here sep why sep why did you do it sep what impelled you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your lives to take these cliffs sep what inspired all the men of the armies that met here sep we look at you, and somehow we know the answer sep it was faith and belief sep it was loyalty and love sep the men of normandy had faith that what they were doing was right, faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just god would grant them mercy on this beachhead, or on the next sep it was the deep knowledge -- and pray god we have not lost it -- that there is a profound moral difference between the use of force for liberation and the use of force for conquest sep you were here to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not doubt your cause sep and you were right not to doubt sep you all knew that some things are worth dying for sep one's country is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man sep all of you loved liberty sep all of you were willing to fight tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind you sep the americans who fought here that morning knew word of the invasion was spreading through the darkness back home sep they fought -- or felt in their hearts, though they couldn't know in fact, that in georgia they were filling the churches at 4: 00 am sep in kansas they were kneeling on their porches and praying sep and in philadelphia they were ringing the liberty bell sep something else helped the men of d-day; their rock-hard belief that providence would have a great hand in the events that would unfold here; that god was an ally in this great cause sep and so, the night before the invasion, when colonel wolverton asked his parachute troops to kneel with him in prayer, he told them: "do not bow your heads, but look up so you can see god and ask his blessing in what we're about to do sep " also, that night, general matthew ridgway on his cot, listening in the darkness for the promise god made to joshua: "i will not fail thee nor forsake thee sep "these are the things that impelled them; these are the things that shaped the unity of the allies sep when the war was over, there were lives to be rebuilt and governments to be returned to the people sep there were nations to be reborn sep above all, there was a new peace to be assured sep these were huge and daunting tasks sep but the allies summoned strength from the faith, belief, loyalty, and love of those who fell here sep they rebuilt a new europe together sep there was first a great reconciliation among those who had been enemies, all of whom had suffered so greatly sep the united states did its part, creating the marshall plan to help rebuild our allies and our former enemies sep the marshall plan led to the atlantic alliance -- a great alliance that serves to this day as our shield for freedom, for prosperity, and for peace sep in spite of our great efforts and successes, not all that followed the end of the war was happy or planned sep some liberated countries were lost sep the great sadness of this loss echoes down to our own time in the streets of warsaw, prague, and east berlin sep the soviet troops that came to the center of this continent did not leave when peace came sep they're still there, uninvited, unwanted, unyielding, almost forty years after the war sep because of this, allied forces still stand on this continent sep today, as forty years ago, our armies are here for only one purpose: to protect and defend democracy sep the only territories we hold are memorials like this one and graveyards where our heroes rest sep we in america have learned bitter lessons from two world wars sep it is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost sep we've learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent sep but we try always to be prepared for peace, prepared to deter aggression, prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms, and yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation sep in truth, there is no reconciliation we would welcome more than a reconciliation with the soviet union, so, together, we can lessen the risks of war, now and forever sep it's fitting to remember here the great losses also suffered by the russian people during world war ii sep twenty million perished, a terrible price that testifies to all the world the necessity of ending war sep i tell you from my heart that we in the united states do not want war sep we want to wipe from the face of the earth the terrible weapons that man now has in his hands sep and i tell you, we are ready to seize that beachhead sep we look for some sign from the soviet union that they are willing to move forward, that they share our desire and love for peace, and that they will give up the ways of conquest sep there must be a changing there that will allow us to turn our hope into action sep we will pray forever that someday that changing will come sep but for now, particularly today, it is good and fitting to renew our commitment to each other, to our freedom, and to the alliance that protects it sep we're bound today by what bound us 40 years ago, the same loyalties, traditions, and beliefs sep we're bound by reality sep the strength of america's allies is vital to the united states, and the american security guarantee is essential to the continued freedom of europe's democracies sep we were with you then; we're with you now sep your hopes are our hopes, and your destiny is our destiny sep here, in this place where the west held together, let us make a vow to our dead sep let us show them by our actions that we understand what they died for sep let our actions say to them the words for which matthew ridgway listened: "i will not fail thee nor forsake thee sep "strengthened by their courage and heartened by their value [valor] and borne by their memory, let us continue to stand for the ideals for which they lived and died sep thank you very much, and god bless you all
ESTP	my fellow citizens: i have requested this opportunity to talk to the people of massachusetts about the tragedy which happened last friday evening sep this morning i entered a plea of guilty to the charge of leaving the scene of an accident sep prior to my appearance in court it would have been [im]proper for me to comment on these matters sep but tonight i am free to tell you what happened and to say what it means to me sep on the weekend of july 18th, i was on martha's vineyard island participating with my nephew, joe kennedy -- as for thirty years my family has participated -- in the annual edgartown sailing regatta sep only reasons of health prevented my wife from accompanying me sep on chappaquiddick island, off martha's vineyard, i attended, on friday evening, july 18th, a cook-out i had encouraged and helped sponsor for a devoted group of kennedy campaign secretaries sep when i left the party, around 11: 15pm, i was accompanied by one of these girls, miss mary jo kopechne sep mary jo was one of the most devoted members of the staff of senator robert kennedy sep she worked for him for four years and was broken up over his death sep for this reason, and because she was such a gentle, kind, and idealistic person, all of us tried to help her feel that she still had a home with the kennedy family sep there is no truth, no truth whatever, to the widely circulated suspicions of immoral conduct that have been leveled at my behavior and hers regarding that evening sep there has never been a private relationship between us of any kind sep i know of nothing in mary jo's conduct on that or any other occasion -- and the same is true of the other girls at that party -- that would lend any substance to such ugly speculation about their character sep nor was i driving under the influence of liquor sep little over one mile away, the car that i was driving on an unlit road went off a narrow bridge which had no guard rails and was built on a left angle to the road sep the car overturned in a deep pond and immediately filled with water sep i remember thinking as the cold water rushed in around my head that i was for certain drowning sep then water entered my lungs and i actual felt the sensation of drowning sep but somehow i struggled to the surface alive sep i made immediate and repeated efforts to save mary jo by diving into the strong and murky current, but succeeded only in increasing my state of utter exhaustion and alarm sep my conduct and conversations during the next several hours, to the extent that i can remember them, make no sense to me at all sep although my doctors informed me that i suffered a cerebral concussion, as well as shock, i do not seek to escape responsibility for my actions by placing the blame either on the physical and emotional trauma brought on by the accident, or on anyone else sep i regard as indefensible the fact that i did not report the accident to the police immediately sep instead of looking directly for a telephone after lying exhausted in the grass for an undetermined time, i walked back to the cottage where the party was being held and requested the help of two friends, my cousin, joseph gargan and phil markham, and directed them to return immediately to the scene with me -- this was sometime after midnight -- in order to undertake a new effort to dive down and locate miss kopechne sep their strenuous efforts, undertaken at some risk to their own lives, also proved futile sep all kinds of scrambled thoughts -- all of them confused, some of them irrational, many of them which i cannot recall, and some of which i would not have seriously entertained under normal circumstances -- went through my mind during this period sep they were reflected in the various inexplicable, inconsistent, and inconclusive things i said and did, including such questions as whether the girl might still be alive somewhere out of that immediate area, whether some awful curse did actually hang over all the kennedys, whether there was some justifiable reason for me to doubt what had happened and to delay my report, whether somehow the awful weight of this incredible incident might in some way pass from my shoulders sep i was overcome, i'm frank to say, by a jumble of emotions: grief, fear, doubt, exhaustion, panic, confusion, and shock sep instructing gargan and markham not to alarm mary jo's friends that night, i had them take me to the ferry crossing sep the ferry having shut down for the night, i suddenly jumped into the water and impulsively swam across, nearly drowning once again in the effort, and returned to my hotel about 2: 00am -- and collapsed in my room sep i remember going out at one point and saying something to the room clerk sep in the morning, with my mind somewhat more lucid, i made an effort to call a family legal advisor, burke marshall, from a public telephone on the chappaquiddick side of the ferry and then belatedly reported the accident to the martha['s] vineyard police sep today, as i mentioned, i felt morally obligated to plead guilty to the charge of leaving the scene of an accident sep no words on my part can possibly express the terrible pain and suffering i feel over this tragic incident sep this last week has been an agonizing one for me and for the members of my family sep and the grief we feel over the loss of a wonderful friend will remain with us the rest of our lives sep these events, the publicity, innuendo, and whispers which have surrounded them and my admission of guilt this morning raises the question in my mind of whether my standing among the people of my state has been so impaired that i should resign my seat in the united states senate sep if at any time the citizens of massachusetts should lack confidence in their senator's character, or his ability -- with or without justification -- he could not in my opinion adequately perform his duties and should not continue in office sep the people of this state, the state which sent john quincy adams, and daniel webster, and charles sumner, and henry cabot lodge, and john kennedy to the united states senate are entitled to representation in that body by men who inspire their utmost confidence sep for this reason, i would understand full well why some might think it right for me to resign sep for me, this will be a difficult decision to make sep it has been seven years since my first election to the senate sep you and i share many memories -- some of them have been glorious, some have been very sad sep the opportunity to work with you and serve massachusetts has made my life worthwhile sep and so i ask you tonight, the people of massachusetts, to think this through with me sep in facing this decision, i seek your advice and opinion sep in making it, i seek your prayers -- for this is a decision that i will have finally to make on my own sep it has been written: a man does what he must -- in spite of personal consequences, in spite of obstacles, and dangers, and pressures -- and that is the basis of all human morality sep 1 sep sep sep whatever may be the sacrifices he faces, if he follows his conscience -- the loss of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow man -- each man must decide for himself the course he will follow sep the stories of the past courage cannot supply courage itself sep for this, each man must look into his own soul sep 2i pray that i can have the courage to make the right decision sep whatever is decided, whatever the future holds for me, i hope that i shall have -- be able to put this most recent tragedy behind me and make some further contribution to our state and mankind -- whether it be in public or private life sep thank you and good night
ESTJ	out of the agony and travail of economic america the committee for industrial organization was born sep to millions of americans exploited without stint by corporate industry and socially debased beyond the understanding of the fortunate, its coming was as welcomed as the dawn to the night watcher sep to a lesser group of americans, infinitely more fortunately situated, blessed with larger quantities of the worlds goods and insolent in their assumption of privilege, its coming was heralded as a harbinger of ill, sinister of purpose, of unclean methods and non-virtuous objectives sep but the committee for industrial organizations is here sep it is now henceforth a definite instrumentality, destined greatly to influence the lives of our people and the internal and external course of the republic sep this is true only because the purposes and objectives of the committee for industrial organization find economic, social, political and moral justification in the hearts of the millions who are its members and the millions more who support it sep the organization and constant onward sweep of this movement exemplifies the resentment of the many toward the selfishness, greed and the neglect of the few sep the workers of the nation were tired of waiting for corporate industry to right their economic wrongs, to alleviate their social agony and to grant them their political rights sep despairing of fair treatment, they resolved to do something for themselves sep they, therefore, have organized a new labor movement, conceived within the principles of the national bill of rights and committed to the proposition that the workers are free to assemble in their own forums, voice their own grievances, declare their own hopes and contract on even terms with modern industry for the sale of their only material possession -- their labor sep the committee for industrial organization has a numerical enrollment of 3,718,000 members sep it has 32 affiliated national and international unions sep of this number 11 unions account for 2,765,000 members sep this group is organized in the textile, auto, garment, lumber, rubber, electrical manufacturing, power, steel, coal and transport industries sep the remaining membership exists in the maritime, oil production and refining, ship building, leather, chemical, retail, meat packing, vegetable canning, metalliferous mining, miscellaneous manufacturing, agricultural labor, and service and miscellaneous industries sep some 200,000 workers are organized into 507 chartered local unions not yet attached to a national industrial union sep this record bespeaks progress sep it is a development without precedent in our own country sep some of this work was accomplished with the enlightened cooperation or the tolerant acquiescence of employers who recognized that a new labor movement was being forged and who were not disposed, in any event, to flout the law of the land sep on the other hand, much of this progress was made in the face of violent and deadly opposition which reached its climax in the slaughter of workers paralleling the massacres of ludlow and homestead sep in the steel industry the corporations generally have accepted collective bargaining and negotiated wage agreements with the committee for industrial organization sep eighty-five per cent of the industry is thus under contract and a peaceful relationship exits between the management and the workers sep written wage contracts have been negotiated with 399 steel companies covering 510,000 men sep one thousand thirty-one local lodges in 700 communities have been organized sep five of the corporations in the steel industry elected to resist collective bargaining and undertook to destroy the steel workers' union sep these companies filled their plants with industrial spies, assembled depots of guns and gas bombs, established barricades, controlled their communities with armed thugs, leased the police power of cities and mobilized the military power of a state to guard them against the intrusion of collective bargaining within their plants sep during this strike 18 steel workers were either shot to death or had their brains clubbed out by police, or armed thugs in the pay of the steel companies sep in chicago, mayor kelly's police force was successful in killing ten strikers before they could escape the fury of the police, shooting eight of them in the back sep one hundred sixty strikers were maimed and injured by police clubs, riot guns and gas bombs and were hospitalized sep hundreds of strikers were arrested, jailed, treated with brutality while incarcerated and harassed by succeeding litigation sep none but strikers were murdered, gassed, injured, jailed or maltreated sep no one had to die except the workers who were standing for the right guaranteed them by the congress and written in the law sep the infamous governor davey, of ohio, successful in the last election because of his reiterated promises of fair treatment to labor, used the military power of the commonwealth on the side of the republican steel company and the youngstown sheet and tube company sep nearly half of the staggering military expenditure incident to the crushing of this strike in ohio was borne by the federal government through the allocation of financial aid to the military establishment of the state sep the steel workers have now buried their dead, while the widows weep and watch their orphaned children become objects of public charity sep the murder of these unarmed men has never been publicly rebuked by any authoritative officer of the state or federal government sep some of them, in extenuation, plead lack of jurisdiction, but murder as a crime against the moral code can always be rebuked without regard to the niceties of legalistic jurisdiction by those who profess to be the keepers of the public conscience sep shortly after kelly's police force in chicago had indulged in their bloody orgy, kelly came to washington looking for political patronage sep that patronage was forthcoming and kelly must believe that the killing of the strikers is no liability in partisan politics sep meanwhile, the steel puppet davey is still governor of ohio, but not for long i think - not for long sep the people of ohio may be relied upon to mete our political justice to one who has betrayed his state, outraged the public conscience and besmirched the public honor sep while the men of the steel industry were going through blood and gas in defense of their rights and their homes and their families, elsewhere on the far-flung c sep i sep o sep front the hosts of labor were advancing and intelligent and permanent progress was being made sep in scores of industries plant after plant and company after company were negotiating sensible working agreements sep the men in the steel industry who sacrificed their all were nor merely aiding their fellows at home but were adding strength to the cause of their comrades in all industry sep labor was marching toward the goal of industrial democracy and contributing constructively toward a more rational arrangement of our domestic economy sep labor does not see industrial strife sep it wants peace, but a peace with justice sep in the long struggle for labors rights it has been patient and forbearing sep sabotage and destruction syndicalism have had no part in the american labor movement sep workers have kept faith in american institutions sep most of the conflicts, which have occurred have been when labors right to live has been challenged and denied sep if there is to be peace in our industrial life let the employer recognize his obligation to his employees -- at least to the degree set forth in existing statutes sep ordinary problems affecting wages, hours, and working conditions, in most instances, will quickly respond to negotiation in the council room sep the united states chamber of commerce, the national association of manufacturers, and similar groups representing industry and financial interests, are rendering a disservice to the american people in their attempts to frustrate the organization of labor and in their refusal to accept collective bargaining as one of our economic institutions sep these groups are encouraging a systematic organization of vigilante groups to fight unionization under the sham pretext of local interests sep they equip these vigilantes with tin hats, wooden clubs, gas masks and lethal weapons and train them in the arts of brutality and oppression sep they bring in snoops, finks, hatchet gangs and chowderhead cohens to infest their plants and disturb the communities sep fascist organizations have been launched and financed under the shabby pretext that the c sep i sep o sep movement is communistic sep the real breeders of discontent and alien doctrines of government and philosophies subversive of good citizenship are such as these who take the law into their own hands sep no tin-hat brigade of goose-stepping vigilantes or bibble-babbling mob of blackguarding and corporation paid scoundrels will prevent the onward march of labor, or divert its purpose to play its natural and rational part in the development of the economic, political and social life of our nation sep unionization, as opposed to communism, presupposes the relation of employment; it is based upon the wage system and it recognizes fully and unreservedly the institution of private property and the right to investment profit sep it is upon the fuller development of collective bargaining, the wider expansion of the labor movement, the increased influence of labor in our national councils, that the perpetuity of our democratic institutions must largely depend sep the organized workers of america, free in their industrial life, conscious partners in production, secure in their homes and enjoying a decent standard of living, will prove the finest bulwark against the intrusion of alien doctrines of government sep do those who have hatched this foolish cry of communism in the c sep i sep o sep fear the increased influence of labor in our democracy sep do they fear its influence will be cast on the side of shorter hours, a better system of distributed employment, better homes for the under-privileged, social security for the aged, a fairer distribution of the national income sep certainly the workers that are being organized want a voice in the determination of these objectives of social justice sep certainly labor wants a fairer share in the national income sep assuredly labor wants a larger participation in increased productive efficiency sep obviously the population is entitled to participate in the fruits of the genius of our men of achievement in the field of the material sciences sep labor has suffered just as our farm population has suffered from a viciously unequal distribution of the national income sep in the exploitation of both classes of workers has been the source of panic and depression, and upon the economic welfare of both rests the best assurance of a sound and permanent prosperity sep in this connection let me call attention to the propaganda which some of our industrialists are carrying on among the farmers sep by pamphlets in the milk cans or attached to machinery and in countless other ways of direct and indirect approach, the farmers of the nation are being told that the increased price of farm machinery and farm supplies is due to the rising wage level brought about by the committee for industrial organization sep and yet it is the industrial millions of this country who constitute the substantial market for all agricultural products sep the interest of the two groups are mutually dependent sep it is when the pay roll goes down that the farmer's realization is diminished, so that his loans become overdue at the bank and the arrival of the tax collector is awaited with fear sep on the other hand it is the prosperity of the farmer that quickness the tempo of manufacturing activities and brings buying power to the millions of urban and industrial workers sep as we view the years that have passed this has always been true and it becomes increasingly imperative that the farm population and the millions of workers in industry must learn to combine their strength for the attainment of mutual and desirable objectives and at the same time learn to guard themselves against the sinister propaganda of those who would divide and exploit them sep under the banner of the committee for industrial organization american labor is on the march sep its objectives today are those it had in the beginning: to strive for the unionization of our unorganized millions of workers and for the acceptance of collective bargaining as a recognized american institution sep it seeks peace with the industrial world sep it seeks cooperation and mutuality of effort with the agricultural population sep it would avoid strikes sep it would have its rights determined under the law by the peaceful negotiations and contract relationships that are supposed to characterize american commercial life sep until an aroused public opinion demands that employers accept that rule, labor has no recourse but to surrender its rights or struggle for their realization with its own economic power sep the objectives of this movement are not political in a partisan sense sep yet it is true that a political party which seeks the support of labor and makes pledges of good faith to labor must, in equity and good conscience, keep that faith and redeem those pledges sep the spectacle of august and dignified members of congress, servants of the people and agents of the republic, skulking in hallways and closets, hiding their faces in a party caucus to prevent a quorum from acting upon a labor measure, is one that emphasizes the perfidy of politicians and blasts the confidence of labor's millions in politician's promises and statesmen's vows sep labor next year cannot avoid the necessity of a political assay of the work and sep deeds of its s
ENFJ	thank you very much sep its a privileg"and an honor to be in the white intellectual ghetto of the west sep we wanted to do a couple of things before we started sep the first is that, based on the fact that sncc, through the articulation of its program by its chairman, has been able to win elections in georgia, alabama, maryland, and by our appearance here will win an election in california, in 1968 i'm going to run for president of the united states sep i just can't make it, 'cause i wasn't born in the united states sep that's the only thing holding me back sep we wanted to say that this is a student conference, as it should be, held on a campus, and that we're not ever to be caught up in the intellectual masturbation of the question of black power sep thats a function of people who are advertisers that call themselves reporters sep oh, for my members and friends of the press, my self-appointed white critics, i was reading mr sep bernard shaw two days ago, and i came across a very important quote which i think is most apropos for you sep he says, "ll criticism is a[n] autobiography sep " dig yourself sep okay sep the philosophers camus and sartre raise the question whether or not a man can condemn himself sep the black existentialist philosopher who is pragmatic, frantz fanon, answered the question sep he said that man could not sep camus and sartre was not sep we in sncc tend to agree with camus and sartre, that a man cannot condemn himself sep were he to condemn himself, he would then have to inflict punishment upon himself sep an example would be the nazis sep any prisoner who -- any of the nazi prisoners who admitted, after he was caught and incarcerated, that he committed crimes, that he killed all the many people that he killed, he committed suicide sep the only ones who were able to stay alive were the ones who never admitted that they committed a crimes [sic] against people -- that is, the ones who rationalized that jews were not human beings and deserved to be killed, or that they were only following orders sep on a more immediate scene, the officials and the population -- the white population -- in neshoba county, mississippi -- thats where philadelphia is -- could not -- could not condemn [sheriff] rainey, his deputies, and the other fourteen men that killed three human beings sep they could not because they elected mr sep rainey to do precisely what he did; and that for them to condemn him will be for them to condemn themselves sep in a much larger view, sncc says that white america cannot condemn herself sep and since we are liberal, we have done it: you stand condemned sep now, a number of things that arises from that answer of how do you condemn yourselves sep seems to me that the institutions that function in this country are clearly racist, and that they're built upon racism sep and the question, then, is how can black people inside of this country move sep and then how can white pe"ple who say theyre not a part of those institutions begin to move sep and how then do we begin to clear away the obstacles that we have in this society, that make us live like human beings sep how can we begin to build institutions that will allow people to relate with each other as human beings sep this country has never done that, especially around the country of white or black sep now, several people have been upset because weve said that integration was irrelevant when initiated by blacks, and that in fact it was a subterfuge, an insidious subterfuge, for the maintenance of white supremacy sep now we maintain that in the past six years or so, this country has been feeding us a "alidomide drug of integration," and that some negroes have been walking down a dream street talking about sitting next to white people; and that that does not begin to solve the problem; that when we went to mississippi we did not go to sit next to ross barnett; we did not go to sit next to jim clark; we went to get them out of our way; and that people ought to understand that; that we were never fighting for the right to integrate, we were fighting against white supremacy sep now, then, in order to understand white supremacy we must dismiss the fallacious notion that white people can give anybody their freedom sep no man can give anybody his freedom sep a man is born free sep you may enslave a man after he is born free, and that is i"act what this country does sep it enslaves black people after theyre born, so that the only acts that white people can do is to stop denying black people their freedom; that is, they must stop denying freedom sep they never give it to anyone sep now we want to take that to its logical extension, so that we could understand, then, what its relevancy would be in terms of new civil rights bills sep i maintain that every civil rights bill in this country was passed for white people, not for black people sep for example, i am black sep i know that sep i also know that while i am black i am a human being, and therefore i have the right to go into any public place sep white people didn't know that sep every time i tried to go into a place they stopped me sep so some boys had to write a bill to tell that white man, "es a human being; dont stop him sep "hat bill was for that white man, not for me sep i knew it all the time sep i knew it all the time sep i knew that i could vote and that that wasnt a privilege; it was my right sep every time i tried i was shot, killed or jailed, beaten or economically deprived sep so somebody had to write a bill for white people to tell them, "hen a black man comes to vote, dont bother him sep "that bill, again, was for white people, not for black people; so that when you talk about open occupancy, i know i can live anyplace i want to live sep it is white people across this country who are incapable of allowing me to live where i want to live sep you need a civil rights bill, not me sep i know i can live where i want to live sep so that the failures to pass a civil rights bill isnt because of black power, isn't because of the student nonviolent coordinating committee; it's not because of the rebellions that are occurring in the major cities sep it is incapability of whites to deal with their own problems inside their own communities sep that is the problem of the failure of the civil rights bill sep and so in a larger sense we must then ask, how is it that black people move sep and what do we do sep but the question in a greater sense is, how can white people who are the majority -- and who are responsible for making democracy work -- make it work sep they have miserably failed to this point sep they have never made democracy work, be it inside the united states, vietnam, south africa, philippines, south america, puerto rico sep wherever american has been, she has not been able to make democracy work; so that in a larger sense, we not only condemn the country for what it's done internally, but we must condemn it for what it does externally sep we see this country trying to rule the world, and someone must stand up and start articulating that this country is not god, and cannot rule the world sep now, then, before we move on we ought to develop the white supremacy attitudes that were either conscious or subconscious thought and how they run rampant through the society today sep for example, the missionaries were sent to africa sep they went with the attitude that blacks were automatically inferior sep as a matter of fact, the first act the missionaries did, you know, when they got to africa was to make us cover up our bodies, because they said it got them excited sep we couldnt go bare-breasted any more because they got excited sep now when the missionaries came to civilize us because we "re uncivilized, educate us because we were uneducated, and give us some -- some literate studies because we were illiterate, they charged a price sep the missionaries came with the bible, and we had the land sep when they left, they had the land, and we still have the bible sep and that has been the rationalization for western civilization as it moves across the world and stealing and plundering and raping everybody in its path sep their one rationalization is that the rest of the world is uncivilized and they are in fact civilized sep and they are un-civil-ized sep and that runs on today, you see, because what we have today is we have what we call "modern-day peace corps missionaries," and they come into our ghettos and they head start, upward lift, bootstrap, and upward bound us into white society, 'cause they dont want to face the real problem which is a man is poor for one reason and one reason only: 'cause he does not have money -- period sep if you want to get rid of poverty, you give people money -- period sep and you ought not to tell me about people who dont work, and you cant give people money wi"t working, 'cause if that were true, youd have to start stopping rockefeller, bobby kennedy, lyndon baines johnson, lady bird johnson, the whole of standard oil, the gulf corp, all of them, including probably a large number of the board of trustees of this university sep so the question, then, clearly, is not whether or not one can work; its who has power sep who has power to make his or her acts legitimate sep that is all sep and that this country, that power is invested in the hands of white people, and they make their acts legitimate sep it is now, therefore, for black people to make our acts legitimate sep now we are now engaged in a psychological struggle in this country, and that is whether or not black people will have the right to use the words they want to use without white people giving their sanction to it; and that we maintain, whether they like it or not, we gonna use the word "ack power" -- and let them address themselves to that; but that we are not going to wait for white people to sanction black power sep were tired waiting; every time black people move in this country, theyre forced to defend their position before they move sep its time that the people who are supposed to be defending their position do that sep that's white people sep they ought to start defending themselves as to why th"ave oppressed and exploited us sep now it is clear that when this country started to move in terms of slavery, the reason for a man being picked as a slave was one reason -- because of the color of his skin sep if one was black one was automatically inferior, inhuman, and therefore fit for slavery; so that the question of whether or not we are individually suppressed is nonsensical, and its a downright lie sep we are oppressed as a group because we are black, not because we are lazy, not because we're apathetic, not because were stupid, not because we smell, not because we eat watermelon and have good rhythm sep we are oppressed because we are black sep and in order to get out of that oppression one must wield the group power that one has, not the individual power which this country then sets the criteria under which a man may come into it sep that is what is called in this country as integration: "u do what i tell you to do and then well let you sit at the table with us sep "and that we are saying that we have to be opposed to that sep we must now set up criteria and that if there's going to be any integration, it's going to be a two-way thing sep if you believe in integration, you can come live in watts sep you can send your children to the ghetto schools sep lets talk about that sep if you believe in integration, then were going to start adopting us some white people to live in our neighborhood sep so it is clear that the question is not one of integration or segregation sep integration is a man's ability to want to move in there by himself sep if someone wants to live in a white neighborhood and he is black, that is his choice sep it should be his rights sep it is not because white people will not allow him sep so vice versa: if a black man wants to live in the slums, that should be his right sep black people will let him sep that is the differ"e sep and it's a difference on which this country makes a number of logical mistakes when they begin to try to criticize the program articulated by sncc sep now we maintain that we cannot be afford to be concerned about 6 percent of the children in this country, black children, who you allow to come into white schools sep we have 94 percent who still live in shacks sep we are going to be concerned about those 94 percent sep you ought to be concerned about them too sep the question is, are we willing to be concerned about those 94 percent sep are we willing to be concerned about the black people who will never get to berkeley, who will never get to harvard, and cannot get an education, so youll never get a chance to rub shoulders with them and say, "ell, hes almost as good as we are; hes not like the others"the question is, how can white society begin to move to see black people as human beings sep i am black, therefore i am; not that i am black and i must go to college to prove myself sep i am black, therefore i am sep and dont deprive me of anything and say to me that you must go to college before you gain access to x, y, and z sep it is only a rationalization for one's oppression sep the -- the political parties in this country do not meet the needs of people on a day-to-day basis sep the question is, how can we build new political institutions that will become the political expressions of people on a day-to-day basis sep the question is, how can you build political institutions that will begin to meet the needs of oakland, california sep and the needs of oakland, california, is not 1,000 policemen with submachine guns sep they don't need that sep they need that least of all sep the question is, how can we build institutions where those people can begin to function on a day-to-day basis, where they can get decent jobs, where they can get decent houses, and where they can begin to participate in the policy and major decisions that affect their lives sep thats what they need, not gestapo troops, because this is not 1942, and if you play like nazis, we playing back with you this time around sep get hip to that sep the question then is, how can white people move to start making the major institutions that they have in this country function the way it is supposed to function sep that is the real question sep and can white people move inside their own community and start tearing down racism where in fact it does exist sep where it exists sep it is you who live in cicero and stop us from living there sep it is white people who stop us from moving into grenada sep it is white people who make sure that we live in the ghettos of this country sep it is white institutions that do that sep they must change sep in order -- in order for america to really live on a basic principle of human relationships, a new society must be born sep racism must die, and the economic exploitation of this country of non-white peoples around the world must also die -- must also die sep now there are several programs that we have in the south, most in poor white communities sep we're trying to organize poor whites on a base where they can begin to move around the question of economic exploitation and political disfranchisement sep we know -- we've heard the theory several times -- but few people are willing to go into there sep the question is, can the white activist not try to be a pepsi generation who comes alive in the black community, but can he be a man whos willing to move into the white community and start organizing where the organization is needed sep can he do that sep the question is, can the white society or the white activist disassociate himself with two clowns who waste time parrying with each other rather than talking about the problems that are facing people in this state sep can you dissociate yourself with those clowns and start to build new institutions that will eliminate all idiots like them sep and the question is, if we are going to do that when and where do we start, and how do we start sep we maintain that we must start doing that inside the white community sep our own personal position politically is that we don't think the democratic party represents the needs of black people sep we know it don't sep and that if, in fact, white people really believe that, the question is, if theyre going to move inside that structure, how are they going to organize around a concept of whiteness based on true brotherhood and based on stopping exploitation, economic exploitation, so that there will be a coalition base for black people to hook up with sep you cannot form a coalition based on national sentiment sep that is not a coalition sep if you need a coalition to redress itself to real changes in this country, white people must start building those institutions inside the white community sep and that is the real question, i think, facing the white activists today sep can they, in fact, begin to move into and tear down the institutions which have put us all in a trick bag that weve be" into for the last hundred years sep i don't think that we should follow what many people say that we should fight to be leaders of tomorrow sep frederick douglass said that the youth should fight to be leaders today sep and god knows we need to be leaders today, 'cause the men who run this country are sick, are sick sep so that can we on a larger sense begin now, today, to start building those institutions and to fight to articulate our position, to fight to be able to control our universities -- we need to be able to do that -- and to fight to control the basic institutions which perpetuate racism by destroying them and building new ones sep thats the real question that face us today, and it is a dilemma because most of us do not know how to work, and that the excuse that most white activists find is to run into the black community sep now we maintain that we cannot have white people working in the black community, and we mean it on a psychological ground sep the fact is that all black people often question whether or not they are equal to whites, because every time they start to do something, white people are arou" showing them how to do it sep if we are going to eliminate that for the generation that comes after us, then black people must be seen in positions of power, doing and articulating for themselves, for themselves sep that is not to say that one is a reverse racist; it is to say that one is moving in a healthy ground; it is to say what the philosopher sartre says: one is becoming an "antiracist racist sep " and this country cant understand that sep maybe it's because it's all caught up in racism sep but i think what you have in sncc is an anti-racist racism sep we are against racists sep now if everybody who is white see themself [sic] as a racist and then see us against him, they're speaking from their own guilt position, not ours, not ours sep now then, the question is, how can we move to begin to change what's going on in this country sep i maintain, as we have in sncc, that the war in vietnam is an illegal and immoral war sep and the question is, what can we do to stop that war sep what can we do to stop the people who, in the name of our country, are killing babies, women, and children sep what can we do to stop that sep and i maintain that we do not have the power in our hands to change that institution, to begin to recreate it, so that they learn to leave the vietnamese people alone, and that the only power we have is the power to say, "ell no sep " to the draft sep we have to say -- we have to say to ourselves that there is a higher law than the law of a racist named mcnamara sep there is a higher law than the law of a fool named rusk sep and there's a higher law than the law of a buffoon named johnson sep its the law of each of us sep it's the law of each of us sep it is the law of each of us saying that we will not allow them to make us hired killers sep we will stand pat sep we will not kill anybody that they say kill sep and if we decide to kill, we're going to decide who we going to kill sep and this country will only be able to stop the war in vietnam when the young men who are made to fight it begin to say, "ell, no, we aint going sep "now then, there's a failure because the peace movement has been unable to get off the college campuses where everybody has a 2s and not going to get drafted anyway sep and the question is, how can you move out of that into the white ghettos of this country and begin to articulate a position for those white students who do not want to go sep we cannot do that sep it is something -- sometimes ironic that many of the peace groups have beginning to call us violent and say they can no longer support us, and we are in fact the most militant organization [for] peace or civil rights or human rights against the war in vietnam in this country today sep there isnt one organization that has begun to meet our stance on the war in vietnam, 'cause we not only say we are against the war in vietnam; we are against the draft sep we are against the draft sep no man has the right to take a man for two years and train him to be a killer sep a man should decide what he wants to do with his life sep so the question then is it becomes crystal clear for black people because we can easily say that anyone fighting in the war in vietnam is nothing but a black mercenary, and that's all he is sep any time a black man leaves the country where he cant vote to supposedly deliver the vote for somebody else, hes a black mercenary sep any time a -- any time a black man leaves this country, gets shot in vietnam on foreign ground, and returns home and you wont give him a burial in his own homeland, hes a black mercenary, a black mercenary sep and that even if i were to belie" lies of johnson, if i were to believe his lies that we're fighting to give democracy to the people in vietnam, as a black man living in this country i wouldnt fight to give this to anybody sep i wouldn't give it to anybody sep so that we have to use our bodies and our minds in the only way that we see fit sep we must begin like the philosopher camus to come alive by saying "o sep " that is the only act in which we begin to come alive, and we have to say "no sep " to many, many things in this country sep this country is a nation of thieves sep it has stole everything it has, beginning with black people, beginning with black people sep and that the question is, how can we move to start changing this country from what it is -- a nation of thieves sep this country cannot justify any longer its existence sep we have become the policeman of the world sep the marines are at our disposal to always bring democracy, and if the vietnamese dont want democracy, well dammit, "ell just wipe them the hell out, 'cause they dont deserve to live if they wont have our way of life sep "here is then in a larger sense, what do you do on your university campus sep do you raise questions about the hundred black students who were kicked off campus a couple of weeks ago sep eight hundred sep eight hundred sep and how does that question begin to move sep do you begin to relate to people outside of the ivory tower and university wall sep do you think youre capable of building those human relationships, as the country now stands sep you're fooling yourself sep it is impossible for white and black people to talk about building a relationship based on humanity when the country is the way it is, when the institutions are clearly against us sep we have taken all the myths of this country and we've found them to be nothing but downright lies sep this country told us that if we worked hard we would succeed, and if that were true we would own this country lock, stock, and barrel -- lock, stock, and barrel -- lock, stock, and barrel sep it is we who have picked the cotton for nothing sep it is we who are the maids in the kitchens of liberal white people sep it is we who are the janitors, the porters, the elevator men; we who sweep up your college floors sep yes, it is we who are the hardest workers and the lowest paid, and the lowest paid sep and that it is nonsensical for people to start talking about human relationships until they're willing to build new institutions sep black people are economically insecure sep white liberals are economically secure sep can you begin to build an economic coalition sep are the liberals willing to share their salaries with the economically insecure black people they so much love sep then if youre not, are you willing to start building new institutions that will provide economic security for black people sep thats the question
INTJ	gentlemen of the jury: as in the case of my co-defendant, alexander berkman, this is also the first time in my life i have ever addressed a jury sep i once had occasion to speak to three judges sep on the day after our arrest it was give out by the u sep s sep marshal and the district attorneys office that the big fish of the no-conscription activities had been caught, and that there would be no more trouble-makers and disturbers to interfere with the highly democratic effort of the government to conscript its young manhood for the european slaughter sep what a pity that the faithful servants of the government, personified in the u sep s sep marsha land the district attorney, should have used such a weak and flimsy net for their big catch sep the moment the anglers pulled their heavily laden net ashore, it broke, and all the labor was so much wasted energy sep the methods employed by marshal mccarthy and his hosts of heroic warriors were sensational enough to satisfy the famous circus men, barnum & baily sep a dozen or more heroes dashing up two flights of stairs, prepared to stake their lives for their country, only to discover the two dangerous disturbers and trouble-makers alexander berkman and emma goldman, in their separate offices, quietly at work at their desks, wielding not a sword, nor a gun or a bomb, but merely their pens sep verily, it required courage to catch such big fish sep to be sure, tow officers equipped with a warrant would have sufficed to carry out the business of arresting the defendants alexander berkman and emma goldman sep even the police know that neither of them is in the habit of running away or hiding under the bed sep but the farce-comedy had to be properly staged if the marshal and the district attorney were to earn immortality sep hence the sensational arrest; hence, also, the raid upon the offices of the blast, mother earth and the no-conscription league sep in their zeal to save the country from the trouble-makers, the marshal and his helpers did not even consider it necessary to produce a search warrant sep after all, what matters a mere scrap of paper when one is called upon to raid the offices of anarchists sep of what consequence is the sanctity of property, the right of privacy, to officials in their dealings with anarchists sep in our day of military training for battle, and anarchist office is an appropriate camping ground sep would the gentlemen who came with marshal mccarthy have dared to go into the offices of morgan, of rockefeller, or of any of those men without a search warrant sep they never showed us the search warrant, although we asked them for it sep nevertheless, they turned our office into a battlefield, so that when they were through with it, it looked like invaded belgium, with the only difference that the invaders were not prussian barbarians but good american patriots bent on making new york safe for democracy sep the stage having been appropriately set for the three-act comedy, and the first act successfully played by carrying off the villains in a madly dashing automobile -- which broke every traffic regulation and barely escaped crushing every one in its way--the second act proved even more ludicrous sep fifty thousand dollars bail was demanded, and real estate refused when offered by a man whose property is rated at three hundred thousand dollars, and that after the district attorney had considered and, in fact, promised to accept the property for one of the defendants, alexander berkman, thus breaking every right guaranteed even to the most heinous criminal sep finally the third act, played by the government in this court during the last week sep the pity of it is that the prosecution knows so little of dramatic construction, else it would have equipped itself with better dramatic material to sustain the continuity of the play sep as it was, the third act fell flat, utterly, and presents the question, why such a tempest in a teapot sep gentlemen of the jury, my comrade and co-defendant having carefully and thoroughly gone into the evidence presented by the prosecution, and having demonstrated its entire failure to prove the charge of conspiracy or any overt acts to carry out that conspiracy, i shall not impose upon your patience by going over the same ground, except to emphasize a few points sep to charge people with having conspired to do something which they have been engaged in doing most of their lives, namely their campaign against war, militarism and conscription as contrary to the best interests of humanity, is an insult to human intelligence sep and how was that charge proven sep by the fact that mother earth and the blast were printed by the same printer and bound in the same bindery sep by the further evidence that the same expressman had delivered to two publications sep an by the still more illuminating fact that on june 2nd mother earth and the blast were given to a reporter at his request, if your please, and gratis sep gentlemen of the jury, you saw the reporter who testified to this overt act sep did any one of you receive the impression that the man was of conscriptable age, and if not in what possible way is the giving of mother earth to a report for news purposes proof demonstrating the overt act sep it was brought out by our witnesses that the mother earth magazine has been published for twelve years; that it was never held up, and that it has always gone through the u sep s sep mail as second-class mail matter sep it was further proven that the magazine appeared each month about the first or second, and that it was sold or given away at the office to whoever wanted a copy sep where, then, is the overt act sep just as the prosecution has utterly failed to prove the charge of conspiracy, so has it also failed to prove the overt act by the flimsy testimony that mother earth was given to a reporter sep the same holds good regarding the blast sep gentlemen of the jury, the district attorney must have learned from the reporters the gist of the numerous interviews which they had with us sep why did he not examine them as to whether or not we had counseled young men not to register sep that would have been a more direct way of getting at the facts sep in the case of the reporter from the new york times, there can be no doubt that the man would have been only too happy to accommodate the district attorney with the required information sep a man who disregards every principle of decency and ethics of his profession as a newspaper man, by turning material given him as news over to the district attorney, would have been glad to oblige a friend sep why did mr sep content neglect such a golden opportunity sep was it no because the reporter of the times, like all the other reporters, must have told the district attorney that the two defendants stated, on each and every occasion, they would not tell people not to register sep perhaps the times reporter refused to go to the extent of perjuring himself sep patrolmen and detectives are not so timid in such matters sep hence mr sep randolph and mr sep cadell, to rescue the situation sep imagine employing tenth-rate stenographers to report the very important speeches of dangerous trouble-makers sep what lack of forethought and efficiency on the part of the district attorney sep but even these two members of the police department failed to prove by their notes that we advised people not to register sep but since they had to produce something incriminating against anarchists, they conveniently resorted to the old standby, always credited to us, we believe in violence and we will use violence sep assuming, gentlemen of the jury, that his sentence was really used at the meeting of may 18th, it would still fail to prove the indictment which charges conspiracy and overt acts to carry out the conspiracy sep and that is all we are charged with sep not violence, not anarchism sep i will go further and say, that had the indictment been for the advocacy of violence, you gentlemen of the jury, would still have to render a verdict of not guilty, since the mere belief in a thing or even the announcement that you would carry out that belief, can not possibly constitute a crime sep however, i wish to say emphatically that no such expression as we believe in violence and we will use violence was uttered at the meeting of may 18th, or at any other meeting sep i could not have employed such a phrase, as there was no occasion for it sep if for no other reason, it is because i want my lectures and speeches to be coherent and logical sep the sentence credited to me is neither sep i have read to you my position toward political violence from a lengthy essay called the psychology of political violence sep but to make that a position clearer and simpler, i wish to say that i am a social student sep it is my mission in life to ascertain the cause of our social evils and of our social difficulties sep as a student of social wrongs it is my aim to diagnose a wrong sep to simply condemn the man who has committed an act of political violence, in order to save my skin, would be as unpardonable as it would be on the part of the physician, who is called to diagnose a case, to condemn the patient because the patient has tuberculosis, caner, or some other disease sep the honest, earnest, sincere physician does not only prescribe medicine, he tries to find out the cause of the disease sep and if the patient is at all capable as to means, the doctor will say to him, get out of this putrid air, get out of the factory, get out of the place where your lungs are being infected sep  he will not merely give him medicine sep he will tell him the cause of the disease sep and that is precisely my position in regard to acts of violence sep that is what i have said on every platform sep i have attempted to explain the cause and the reason for acts of political violence sep it is organized violence on top which creates individual violence at the bottom sep it is the accumulated indignation against organized wrong, organized crime, organized injustice which drives the political offender to his act sep to condemn him means to be blind to the causes which make him sep i can no more do it, nor have i the right to, than the physician who were to condemn the patient for his disease sep you and i and all of us who remain indifferent to the crimes of poverty, of war, of human degradation, are equally responsible for the act committed by the political offender sep may i therefore be permitted to say, in the words of a great teacher: he who is without sin among you, let him cast the first stone sep  does that mean advocating violence sep you might as well accuse jesus of advocating prostitution, because he took the part of the prostitute, mary magdalene sep gentlemen of the jury, the meeting of the 18th of may was called primarily for the purpose of voicing the position of the conscientious objector and to point out the evils of conscription sep now, who and what is the conscientious objector sep is he really a shirker, a slacker, or a coward sep to call him that is to be guilty of dense ignorance of the forces which impel men and women to stand out against the whole world like a glittering lone star upon a dark horizon sep the conscientious objector is impelled by what president wilson in his speech of feb sep 3, 1917, called the righteous passion for justice upon which all war, all structure of family, state and of mankind must rest as the ultimate base of our existence or our liberty sep  the righteous passion for justice which can never express itself in human slaughter -- that is the force which makes the conscientious objector sep poor indeed is the country which fails to recognize the importance of that new type of humanity as the ultimate base of our existence and liberty sep  it will find itself barren of that which makes for character and quality in its people sep the meeting of may 18th was held before the draft bill had actually gone into effect sep the president signed it late in the evening of the 18th sep whatever was said at the meeting, even if i had counseled young men not to register, that meeting cannot serve as proof of an overt act sep why, then, has the prosecuting attorney dwelt so much, at such length, and with such pains on that meeting, and so little on the other meetings held on the eve of registration and after sep is it not because the district attorney knew that we had no stenographic notes of that meeting sep he knew it because he was approached by mr sep weinberger and other friends for a copy of the transcript, which request he refused sep evidently, the district attorney felt safe to use the notes of a patrolman and a detective, knowing that they would swear to anything their superiors wanted sep i never like to accuse anyone -- i wouldnt go so far as my co-defendant, mr sep berkman, in saying that the district attorney doctored the document; i dont know whether he did or not sep but i do know that patrolman randolph and detective cadell doctored the notes, for the simple reason that i didnt say those things sep but though we could not produce our own stenographic notes, we have been able to prove by men and women of unimpeachable character and high intelligence that the notes of randolph are utterly false sep we have also proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and mr sep content did not dare question our proof, that at the hunts point palace, held on the eve or registration, i expressly stated that i cannot and will not tell people not to register sep we have further proven that this was my definite stand, which was explained in my statement sent from springfield and read at the meeting of may 23rd sep when we go through the entire testimony given on behalf of the prosecution, i insist that there is not one single point to sustain the indictment for conspiracy or to prove the overt acts we are supposed to have committed sep but we were even compelled to bring a man eighty years of age to the witness stand in order to stop, if possible, and intention to drag in the question of german money sep it is true, and i appreciate it, that mr sep content said he had no knowledge of it sep but, gentlemen of the jury, somebody from the district attorneys office or someone from the marshals office must have given out the statement that a bank receipt for $2,400 was found in my office and must have told the newspapers the fake story of german money sep as if we would ever touch german money, or russian money, or american money coming from the ruling class, to advance our ideas sep but in order to forestall any suspicion, any insinuation, in order to stand clear before you, we were compelled to bring an old man here to inform you that he has been a radical all his life, that he is interested in our ideas, and that he is the man who contributed the money for radical purposes and for the work of miss goldman sep gentlemen of the jury, you will be told by the court, i am sure, that when you render a verdict you must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt; that you must not assume that we are guilty before we are proven guilty; and that it is your duty to assume that we are innocent sep and yet, as a matter of fact, the burden of proof has been laid upon us sep we had to bring witnesses sep if we had had time we could have brought fifty more witnesses, each corroborating the others sep some of those people have no relation with us sep some are writers, poets, contributors to the most conventional magazines sep is it likely that they would swear to something in our favor if it were not the truth sep therefore i insist, as did my co-defendant alexander berkman, that the prosecution has made a very poor showing in proving the conspiracy or any overt act sep gentlemen of the jury, we have been in public life for twenty-seven years sep we have been haled into court, in and out of season -- we have never denied our position sep even the police know that emma goldman and alexander berkman are not shirkers sep you have had occasion during this trial to convince yourselves that we do not deny sep we have gladly and proudly claimed responsibility, not only for what we ourselves have said and written, but even for things written by others and with which we did not agree sep is it plausible, then, that we would go through the ordeal, trouble and expense of a lengthy trial to escape responsibility in this instance sep a thousand times no sep but we refuse to be tried on a trumped-up charge, or to be convicted by perjured testimony, merely because we are anarchists and hated by the class whom we have openly fought for many years sep gentlemen, during our examination of talesmen, when we asked whether you would be prejudiced against us if it were proven that we propagated ideas and opinions contrary to those held by the majority, you were instructed by the court to say, if they are within the law sep  but what the court did not tell you is, that no new faith -- not even the most humane and peaceable -- has ever been considered within the law by those who were in power sep the history of human growth is at the same time the history of every new idea heralding the approach of a brighter dawn, and the brighter dawn has always been considered illegal, outside of the law sep gentlemen of the jury, most of you, i take it, are believers in the teachings of jesus sep bear in mind that he was put to death by those who considered his views as being against the law sep i also take it that you are proud of you americanism sep remember that those who fought and bled for your liberties were in their time considered as being against the law, as dangerous disturbers and trouble-makers sep they not only preached violence, but they carried out their ideas by throwing tea into the boston harbor sep they said that resistance to tyranny is obedience to god sep  they wrote a dangerous document called the declaration of independence sep a document which continues to be dangerous to this day, and for the circulation of which a young man was sentenced to ninety days prison in a new your court, only the other day sep they were the anarchists of their time -- they were never within the law sep your government is allied with the french republic sep need i call you attention to the historic fact that the great upheaval in france was brought about by extra-legal means sep the dantes, the robespieres, the marats, the herberts, aye even the man who is responsible for the most stirring revolutionary music, the marseillaise (which unfortunately has deteriorated into a war tune) even camille desmoulins, were never within the law sep but for those great pioneers and rebels, france would have continued under the yoke of the idle louis xvi sep , to whom the sport of shooting jack rabbits was more important than the destiny of the people of france sep ah, gentlemen, on the very day when we were being tried for conspiracy and overt acts, your city officials and representatives welcomed with music and festivities the russian commission sep are you aware of the fact that nearly all of the members of that commission have only recently been released from exile sep the ideas they propagated were never within the law sep for nearly a hundred years, from 1825 to 1917, the tree of liberty in russia was watered by the blood of her martyrs sep no greater heroism, no nobler lives had ever been dedicated to humanity sep not one of them worked within the law sep i could continue to enumerate almost endlessly the hosts of men and women in every land and in every period whose ideas and ideals redeemed the world because they were not within the law sep never can a new idea move within the law sep it matters not whether that idea pertains to political and social changes or to any other domain of human thought and expression -- to science, literature, music; in fact, everything that makes for freedom and joy and beauty must refuse to move within the law sep how can it be otherwise sep the law is stationary, fixed, mechanical, a chariot wheel which grinds all alike without regard to time, place and condition, without ever taking into account cause and effect, without ever going into the complexity of the human soul sep progress knows nothing of fixity sep it cannot be pressed into a definite mould sep it cannot bow to the dictum, i have ruled, i am the regulating finger of god sep  progress is ever renewing, ever becoming, ever changing -- never is it within the law sep if that be crime, we are criminals even like jesus, socrates, galileo, bruno, john brown and scores of others sep we are in good company, among those whom havelock ellis, the greatest living psychologist, describes as the political criminals recognized by the whole civilized world, except america, as men and women who out of deep love for humanity, out of a passionate reverence for liberty and an all-absorbing devotion to an ideal are ready to pay for their faith even with their blood sep we cannot do otherwise if we are to be true to ourselves -- we know that the political criminal is the precursor of human progress -- the political criminal of today must needs be the hero, the martyr and the saint of the new age sep but, says the prosecuting attorney, the press and the unthinking rabble, in high and low station, that is a dangerous doctrine and unpatriotic at this time sep no doubt it is sep but are we to be held responsible for something which is as unchangeable and unalienable as the very stars hanging in the heave
ESTP	your eminences, your excellencies, mr sep president: on behalf of mrs sep kennedy, her children, the parents and sisters of robert kennedy, i want to express what we feel to those who mourn with us today in this cathedral and around the world sep we loved him as a brother, and as a father, and as a son sep from his parents, and from his older brothers and sisters -- joe and kathleen and jack -- he received an inspiration which he passed on to all of us sep he gave us strength in time of trouble, wisdom in time of uncertainty, and sharing in time of happiness sep he will always be by our side sep love is not an easy feeling to put into words sep nor is loyalty, or trust, or joy sep but he was all of these sep he loved life completely and he lived it intensely sep a few years back, robert kennedy wrote some words about his own father which expresses [sic] the way we in his family felt about him sep he said of what his father meant to him, and i quote: what it really all adds up to is love -- not love as it is described with such facility in popular magazines, but the kind of love that is affection and respect, order and encouragement, and support sep our awareness of this was an incalculable source of strength, and because real love is something unselfish and involves sacrifice and giving, we could not help but profit from it sep and he continued,beneath it all, he has tried to engender a social conscience sep there were wrongs which needed attention sep there were people who were poor and needed help sep and we have a responsibility to them and to this country sep through no virtues and accomplishments of our own, we have been fortunate enough to be born in the united states under the most comfortable conditions sep we, therefore, have a responsibility to others who are less well off sep that is what robert kennedy was given sep what he leaves to us is what he said, what he did, and what he stood for sep a speech he made to the young people of south africa on their day of affirmation in 1966 sums it up the best, and i would like to read it now: there is discrimination in this world and slavery and slaughter and starvation sep governments repress their people; millions are trapped in poverty while the nation grows rich and wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere sep these are differing evils, but they are the common works of man sep they reflect the imperfection of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, our lack of sensibility towards the suffering of our fellows sep but we can perhaps remember -- even if only for a time -- that those who live with us are our brothers; that they share with us the same short moment of life; that they seek -- as we do -- nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can sep surely, this bond of common faith, this bond of common goal, can begin to teach us something sep surely, we can learn, at least, to look at those around us as fellow men sep and surely we can begin to work a little harder to bind up the wounds among us and to become in our own hearts brothers and countrymen once again sep the answer is to rely on youth -- not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease sep the cruelties and obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to the obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans sep they cannot be moved by those who cling to a present that is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement and danger that come with even the most peaceful progress sep it is a revolutionary world we live in, and this generation at home and around the world has had thrust upon it a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived sep some believe there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the world's ills sep yet many of the world's great movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work of a single man sep a young monk began the protestant reformation; a young general extended an empire from macedonia to the borders of the earth; a young woman reclaimed the territory of france; and it was a young italian explorer who discovered the new world, and the 32 year-old thomas jefferson who [pro]claimed that "all men are created equal sep "these men moved the world, and so can we all sep few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation sep *it is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is shaped sep * each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current that can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance sep few are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society sep moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence sep yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change a world that yields most painfully to change sep and i believe that in this generation those with the courage to enter the moral conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the globe sep for the fortunate among us, there is the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who enjoy the privilege of education sep but that is not the road history has marked out for us sep like it or not, we live in times of danger and uncertainty sep but they are also more open to the creative energy of men than any other time in history sep all of us will ultimately be judged, and as the years pass we will surely judge ourselves on the effort we have contributed to building a new world society and the extent to which our ideals and goals have shaped that event sep *the future does not belong to those who are content with today, apathetic toward common problems and their fellow man alike, timid and fearful in the face of new ideas and bold projects sep rather it will belong to those who can blend vision, reason and courage in a personal commitment to the ideals and great enterprises of american society sep * our future may lie beyond our vision, but it is not completely beyond our control sep it is the shaping impulse of america that neither fate nor nature nor the irresistible tides of history, but the work of our own hands, matched to reason and principle, that will determine our destiny sep there is pride in that, even arrogance, but there is also experience and truth sep in any event, it is the only way we can live sep that is the way he lived sep that is what he leaves us sep my brother need not be idealized, or enlarged in death beyond what he was in life; to be remembered simply as a good and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop it sep those of us who loved him and who take him to his rest today, pray that what he was to us and what he wished for others will some day come to pass for all the world sep as he said many times, in many parts of this nation, to those he touched and who sought to touch him: some men see things as they are and say why sep i dream things that never were and say why not
ENTJ	mr sep chairman, senator thurmond, members of the committee: my name is anita f sep hill, and i am a professor of law at the university of oklahoma sep i was born on a farm in okmulgee county, oklahoma, in 1956 sep i am the youngest of 13 children sep i had my early education in okmulgee county sep my father, albert hill, is a farmer in that area sep my mother's name is irma hill sep she is also a farmer and a housewife sep my childhood was one of a lot of hard work and not much money, but it was one of solid family affection, as represented by my parents sep i was reared in a religious atmosphere in the baptist faith, and i have been a member of the antioch baptist church in tulsa, oklahoma, since 1983 sep it is a very warm part of my life at the present time sep for my undergraduate work, i went to oklahoma state university and graduated from there in 1977 sep i am attaching to this statement a copy of my resume for further details of my education sep thank you sep i graduated from the university with academic honors and proceeded to the yale law school, where i received my jd degree in 1980 sep upon graduation from law school, i became a practicing lawyer with the washington, dc, firm of ward, hardraker, and ross sep in 1981, i was introduced to now judge thomas by a mutual friend sep judge thomas told me that he was anticipating a political appointment, and he asked if i would be interested in working with him sep he was, in fact, appointed as assistant secretary of education for civil rights sep after he was -- after he had taken that post, he asked if i would become his assistant, and i accepted that position sep in my early period there, i had two major projects sep the first was an article i wrote for judge thomas's signature on the education of minority students sep the second was the organization of a seminar on high-risk students which was abandoned because judge thomas transferred to the eeoc where he became the chairman of that office sep during this period at the department of education, my working relationship with judge thomas was positive sep i had a good deal of responsibility and independence sep i thought he respected my work and that he trusted my judgment sep after approximately three months of working there, he asked me to go out socially with him sep what happened next and telling the world about it are the two most difficult things -- experiences of my life sep it is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and sleepless number -- a great number of sleepless nights that i am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone but my close friends sep i declined the invitation to go out socially with him and explained to him that i thought it would jeopardize at what -- at -- at the time i considered to be a very good working relationship sep i had a normal social life with other men outside of the office sep i believed then, as now, that having a social relationship with a person who was supervising my work would be ill-advised sep i was very uncomfortable with the idea and told him so sep i thought that by saying no and explaining my reasons my employer would abandon his social suggestions sep however, to my regret, in the following few weeks, he continued to ask me out on several occasions sep he pressed me to justify my reasons for saying no to him sep these incidents took place in his office or mine sep they were in the form of private conversations which not -- would not have been overheard by anyone else sep my working relationship became even more strained when judge thomas began to use work situations to discuss sex sep on these occasions, he would call me into his office for reports on education issues and projects, or he might suggest that, because of the time pressures of his schedule, we go to lunch to a government cafeteria sep after a brief discussion of work, he would turn the conversation to a discussion of sexual matters sep his conversations were very vivid sep he spoke about acts that he had seen in pornographic films involving such matters as women having sex with animals and films showing group sex or rape scenes sep he talked about pornographic materials depicting individuals with large penises or large breasts involved in various sex acts sep on several occasions, thomas told me graphically of his own sexual prowess sep because i was extremely uncomfortable talking about sex with him at all, and particularly in such a graphic way, i told him that i did not want to talk about these subjects sep i would also try to change the subject to education matters or to nonsexual personal matters such as his background or his beliefs sep my efforts to change the -- the subject were rarely successful sep throughout the period of these conversations, he also, from time to time, asked me for social engagements sep my reaction to these conversations was to avoid them by eliminating opportunities for us to engage in extended conversations sep this was difficult because at the time i was his only assistant at the office of education -- or office for civil rights sep during the latter part of my time at the department of education, the social pressures and any conversation of his offensive behavior ended sep i began both to believe and hope that our working relationship could be a proper, cordial, and professional one sep when judge thomas was made chair of the eeoc, i needed to face the question of whether to go with him sep i was asked to do so, and i did sep the work itself was interesting, and at that time it appeared that the sexual overtures which had so troubled me had ended sep i also faced the realistic fact that i had no alternative job sep while i might have gone back to private practice, perhaps in my old firm or at another, i was dedicated to civil rights work, and my first choice was to be in that field sep moreover, the department of education itself was a dubious venture sep president reagan was seeking to abolish the entire department sep for my first months at the eeoc, where i continued to be an assistant to judge thomas, there were no sexual conversations or overtures sep however, during the fall and winter of 1982, these began again sep the comments were random and ranged from pressing me about why i didn't go out with him to remarks about my personal appearance sep i remember his saying that some day i would have to tell him the real reason that i wouldn't go out with him sep he began to show displeasure in his tone and voice and his demeanor and his continued pressure for an explanation sep he commented on what i was wearing in terms of whether it made me more or less sexually attractive sep the incidents occurred in his inner office at the eeoc sep one of the oddest episodes i remember was an occasion in which thomas was drinking a coke in his office sep he got up from the table at which we were working, went over to his desk to get the coke, looked at the can and asked, "who has pubic hair on my coke sep " on other occasions, he referred to the size of his own penis as being larger than normal, and he also spoke on some occasions of the pleasures he had given to women with oral sex sep at this point, late 1982, i began to feel severe stress on the job sep i began to be concerned that clarence thomas might take out his anger with me by degrading me or not giving me important assignments sep i also thought that he might find an excuse for dismissing me sep in january of 1983, i began looking for another job sep i was handicapped because i feared that, if he found out, he might make it difficult for me to find other employment and i might be dismissed from the job i had sep another factor that made my search more difficult was that there was a period -- this was during a period of a hiring freeze in the government sep in february 1983, i was hospitalized for five days on an emergency basis for an acute -- for acute stomach pain, which i attributed to stress on the job sep once out of the hospital, i became more committed to find other employment and sought further to minimize my contact with thomas sep this became easier when allison duncan became office director, because most of my work was then funneled through her and i had contact with clarence thomas mostly in staff meetings sep in the spring of 1983, an opportunity to teach at oral roberts university opened up sep i participated in a seminar -- taught an afternoon session and seminar at oral roberts university sep the dean of the -- of the university saw me teaching and inquired as to whether i would be interested in furthering -- pursuing a career in teaching, beginning at oral roberts university sep i agreed to take the job in large part because of my desire to escape the pressures i felt at the eeoc, due to judge thomas sep when i informed him that i was leaving in july, i recall that his response was that now i would no longer have an excuse for not going out with him sep i told him that i still preferred not to do so sep at some time after that meeting, he asked if he could take me to dinner at the end of the term sep when i declined, he assured me that the dinner was a professional courtesy only and not a social invitation sep i reluctantly agreed to accept that invitation, but only if it was at the very end of a working day sep on, as i recall, the last day of my employment at the eeoc in the summer of 1983, i did have dinner with clarence thomas sep we went directly from work to a restaurant near the office sep we talked about the work i had done, both at education and at the eeoc sep he told me that he was pleased with all of it except for an article and speech that i had done for him while we were at the office for civil rights sep finally, he made a comment that i will vividly remember sep he said that if i ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career sep this was not an apology, nor was it an explanation sep that was his last remark about the possibility of our going out or reference to his behavior sep in july of 1983, i left washington, d sep c sep area and i've had minimal contacts with judge clarence thomas since sep i am of course aware from the press that some questions have been raised about conversations i had with judge clarence thomas after i left the eeoc sep from 1983 until today, i have seen judge thomas only twice sep on one occasion, i needed to get a reference from him, and on another he made a public appearance in tulsa sep on one occasion he called me at home and we had an inconsequential conversation sep on one occasion he called me without reaching me, and i returned the call without reaching him, and nothing came of it sep i have, on at least three occasions, been asked to [act] as a conduit to him for others sep i knew his secretary, diane holt sep we had worked together at both eeoc and education sep there were occasions on which i spoke to her, and on some of these occasions undoubtedly i passed on some casual comment to then chairman thomas sep there were a series of calls in the first three months of 1985, occasioned by a group in tulsa, which wished to have a civil rights conference sep they wanted judge thomas to be the speaker and enlisted my assistance for this purpose sep i did call in january and february to no effect, and finally suggested to the person directly involved, susan cahall, that she put the -- that she put the matter into her own hands and call directly sep she did so in march of 1985 sep in connection with that march invitation, ms sep cahall wanted conference materials for the seminar and some research was needed sep i was asked to try to get the information and did attempt to do so sep there was another call about another possible conference in the july of 1985 sep in august of 1987, i was in washington, d sep c sep and i did call diane holt sep in the course of this conversation, she asked me how long i was going to be in town and i told her sep it is recorded in the message as august 15 sep it was, in fact, august 20th sep she told me about judge thomas's marriage and i did say, "congratulate him sep "it is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration that i am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone except my closest friends sep as i've said before these last few days have been very trying and very hard for me, and it hasn't just been the last few days this week sep it has actually been over a month now that i have been under the strain of this issue sep telling the world is the most difficult experience of my life, but it is very close to having to live through the experience that occasion this meeting sep i may have used poor judgment early on in my relationship with this issue sep i was aware, however, that telling at any point in my career could adversely affect my future career sep and i did not want early on to burn all the bridges to the eeoc sep as i said, i may have used poor judgment sep perhaps i should have taken angry or even militant steps, both when i was in the agency, or after i left it sep but i must confess to the world that the course that i took seemed the better as well as the easier approach sep i declined any comment to newspapers, but later when senate staff asked me about these matters i felt i had a duty to report sep i have no personal vendetta against clarence thomas sep i seek only to provide the committee with information which it may regard as relevant sep it would have been more comfortable to remain silent sep it took no initiative to inform anyone -- i took no initiative to inform anyone sep but when i was asked by a representative of this committee to report my experience, i felt that i had to tell the truth sep i could not keep silent
INTJ	mr sep chairman and fellow countrymen: it is with a great deal of genuine pleasure that i find myself in pueblo, and i feel it a compliment in this beautiful hall sep one of the advantages of this hall, as i look about, is that you are not too far away from me, because there is nothing so reassuring to men who are trying to express the public sentiment as getting into real personal contact with their fellow citizens sep i have gained a renewed impression as i have crossed the continent this time of the homogeneity of this great people to whom we belong sep they come from many stocks, but they are all of one kind sep they come from many origins, but they are all shot through with the same principles and desire the same righteous and honest things sep i have received a more inspiring impression this time of the public opinion of the united states than it was ever my privilege to receive before sep the chief pleasure of my trip has been that it has nothing to do with my personal fortunes, that it has nothing to do with my personal reputation, that it has nothing to do with anything except great principles uttered by americans of all sorts and of all parties which we are now trying to realize at this crisis of the affairs of the world sep but there have been unpleasant impressions as well as pleasant impressions, my fellow citizens, as i have crossed the continent sep i have perceived more and more that men have been busy creating an absolutely false impression of what the treaty of peace and the covenant of the league of nations contain and mean sep i find, moreover, that there is an organized propaganda against the league of nations and against the treaty proceeding from exactly the same sources that the organized propaganda proceeded from which threatened this country here and there with disloyalty, and i want to say -- i cannot say too often -- any man who carries a hyphen about with him carries a dagger that he is ready to plunge into the vitals of this republic whenever he gets ready sep if i can catch any man with a hyphen in this great contest i will know that i have got an enemy of the republic sep my fellow citizens, it is only certain bodies of foreign sympathies, certain bodies of sympathy with foreign nations that are organized against this great document which the american representatives have brought back from paris sep therefore, in order to clear away the mists, in order to remove the impressions, in order to check the falsehoods that have clustered around this great subject, i want to tell you a few very simple things about the treaty and the covenant sep do not think of this treaty of peace as merely a settlement with germany sep it is that sep it is a very severe settlement with germany, but there is not anything in it that she did not earn sep indeed, she earned more than she can ever be able to pay for, and the punishment exacted of her is not a punishment greater than she can bear, and it is absolutely necessary in order that no other nation may ever plot such a thing against humanity and civilization sep but the treaty is so much more than that sep it is not merely a settlement with germany; it is a readjustment of those great injustices which underlie the whole structure of european and asiatic society sep this is only the first of several treaties sep they are all constructed upon the same plan sep the austrian treaty follows the same lines sep the treaty with hungary follows the same lines sep the treaty with bulgaria follows the same lines sep the treaty with turkey, when it is formulated, will follow the same lines sep what are those lines sep they are based upon the purpose to see that every government dealt with in this great settlement is put in the hands of the people and taken out of the hands of coteries and of sovereigns, who had no right to rule over the people sep it is a peoples treaty, that accomplishes by a great sweep of practical justice the liberation of men who never could have liberated themselves, and the power of the most powerful nations ahs been devoted not to their aggrandizement but to the liberation of people whom they could have put under their control if they had chosen to do so sep not one foot of territory is demanded by submission to their authority is demanded by them sep the men who sat around the table in paris knew that the time had come when the people were no longer going to consent to live under masters, but were going to live the lives that they chose themselves, to live under such governments as they chose themselves to erect sep that is the fundamental principle of this great settlement sep and we did not stop with that sep we added a great international charter for the rights of labor sep reject this treaty, impair it, and this is the consequence of the laboring men of the world, that there is no international tribunal which can bring the moral judgments of the world to bear upon the great labor questions of the day sep what we need to do with regard to the labor questions of the day, my fellow countrymen, is to lift them into the light, is to lift them out of the haze and distraction of passion, of hostility, out into the calm spaces where men look at things without passion sep the more men you get into a great discussion the more you exclude passion sep just as soon as the calm judgment of the worlds is directed upon the question of justice to labor, labor is going to have to forum such as it never was supplied with before, and men everywhere are going to see that the problem of labor is nothing more not less than the problem of the elevation of humanity sep we must see that all the questions which have disturbed the world, all the questions which have disturbed the processes of industry, shall be brought out where men of all points of view, men of all attitudes of mind, men of all kinds of experience, may contribute their part of the settlement of the great questions which we must settle and cannot ignore sep at the front of this great treaty is put the covenant of the league of nations sep it will also be at the front of the austrian treaty and the hungarian treaty and the bulgarian treaty and the treaty with turkey sep every one of them will contain the covenant of the league of nations, because you cannot work any of them without the covenant of the league of nations sep unless you get the united, concerted purpose and power of the great governments of the world behind this settlement, it will fall down like a house of cards sep there is only one power to put behinds the liberation of mankind, and that is the power of mankind sep it is the power of the united moral forces of the world, and in the covenant of the league of nations the moral forces of the world are mobilized sep for what purpose sep reflect, my fellow citizens, that the membership of this great league is going to include all the great fighting nations of the world, as well as the weak ones sep it is not for the present going to include germany, but for the time being germany is not a great fighting country sep all the nations that have power that can be mobilized are going to be members of this league, including the united states sep and what do they unite for sep they enter into a solemn promise to one another they will never use their power against one another for aggression; that they never will impair the territorial integrity of a neighbor; that they never will interfere with the political independence of a neighbor; that they will abide by the principle that great populations are entitled to determine their own destiny and that they will not interfere with that destiny; and that no matter what differences arise amongst them they will never resort to war without first having done one or other of two things -- either submitted the matter of controversy to arbitration, in which case they agree to abide by the result without question, or submitted it to the consideration of the council of the league of nations, laying before that council all the documents, all the facts, agreeing that the council can publish the documents, all the facts, agreeing that the council can publish the documents and the facts to the whole world, agreeing that there shall be six months allowed for the mature consideration of those facts by the council, and agreeing that at the expiration of the six months, even if they are not then ready to accept the advice of the council with regard to the settlement of the dispute, they will still not go to war for another three months sep in other words, they consent, no matter what happens, to submit every matter of difference between them to the judgment of mankind, and just so certainly as they do that, my fellow citizens, war will be in the far background, war will be pushed out of that foreground of terror in which it has kept the world for generation after generation, and men will know that there will be a calm time of deliberate counsel sep the most dangerous thing for a bad cause is to expose it to the opinion of the world sep the most certain way that you can prove that a man is mistaken is by letting all his neighbors know what he thinks, by letting all his neighbors know what he thinks, by letting all his neighbors discuss what he thinks, and if he is in the wrong you will notice that he will stay at home, he will not walk on the street sep he will be afraid of the eyes of his neighbors sep he will be afraid of their judgment of his character sep he will know that his cause is lost unless he can sustain it by the arguments of right and of justice sep the same law that applies to individuals applies to nations sep but, you say, we have heard that we might be at a disadvantage in the league of nations sep  well, whoever told you that either was deliberately falsifying or he had not read the covenant of the league of nations sep i leave him the choice sep i want to give you a very simple account of the organization of the league of nations and let you judge for yourselves sep it is a very simple organization sep the power of the league, or rather the activities of the league, lie in two bodies sep there is the council, which consists of one representative from each of the principal allied and associated powers -- that is to say, the united states, great britain, france, italy, and japan, along with four other representatives of smaller powers chosen out of the general body of the membership of the league sep the council is the source of very active policy of the league, and no active policy of the league can be adopted without a unanimous vote of the council sep that is explicitly stated in the covenant itself sep does it not evidently follow that the league of nations can adopt no policy whatever without the consent of the united states sep the affirmative vote of the representative of the united states is necessary in every case sep now, you have heard of six votes belonging to the british empire sep those six votes are not in the council sep they are in the assembly, and the interesting thing is that the assembly does not vote sep i must qualify that statement a little, but essentially it is absolutely true sep in every matter in which the assembly is given a voice, and there are only four or five, its vote does not count unless concurred in by the representatives of all the nations represented on the council, so the at there is no validity to any vote of the assembly unless in that vote also the representative of the united states concurs sep that one vote of the united states is as big as the six votes of the british empire sep i am not jealous for advantage, my fellow citizens, but i think that is a perfectly safe situation sep there is no validity in a vote, either by the council or the assembly, in which we do not concur sep so much for the statements about the six votes for the british empire sep look at it in another aspect sep the assembly is the talking body sep the assembly was created in order that anybody that purposed anything wrong should be subjected to the awkward circumstance that everybody could talk about it sep this is the great assembly in which all the things that are likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding between nations are to be exposed to the general view, and i want to ask you if you think it was unjust, unjust to the united states, that speaking parts should be assigned to the several portions of the british empire sep do you think it unjust that there should be some spokesman in debate for that fine little stout republic down in the pacific, new zealand sep do you think it was unjust that australia should be allowed to stand up and take part in the debate -- australia, from which we have learned some of the most useful progressive policies of modern time, a little nation only five million in a great continent, but counting for several times five in its activities and in its interest in liberal reform sep do you think it unjust that that little republic down in south africa, whose gallant resistance to being subjected to any outside authority at all we admired for so many months and whose fortunes we followed with such interest, should have a speaking part sep great britain obliged south africa to submit to her sovereignty, but she immediately after that felt that it was convenient and right to hand the whole self-government of that colony over to the very men whom she had beaten sep the representatives of south africa in paris were two of the most distinguished generals of the boer army, two of the realest men i ever met, two men that could talk sober counsel and wise advice, along with the best statesmen in europe sep to exclude gen sep botha and gen sep smuts from the right to stand up in the parliament of the world and say something concerning the affairs of mankind would be absurd sep and what about canada sep is not canada a good neighbor sep i ask you is not canada more likely to agree with the united states than with great britain sep canada has a speaking part sep and then, for the first time in the history of the world, that great voiceless multitude, that throng hundreds of millions strong in india, has a voice, and i want to testify that some of the wisest and most dignified figures in the peace conference at paris came form india, men who seemed to carry in their minds an older wisdom than the rest of us had, whose traditions ran back into so many of the unhappy fortunes of mankind that they seemed very useful counselors as to how some ray of hope and some prospect of happiness could be opened to its people sep i for my part have no jealousy whatever of those five speaking parts in the assembly sep those speaking parts cannot translate themselves into five votes that can in any matter override the voice and purpose of the united states sep let us sweep aside all this language of jealousy sep let us be big enough to know the facts and to welcome the facts, because the facts are based upon the principle that america has always fought for, namely, the equality of self-governing peoples, whether they were big or little -- not counting men, but counting rights, not counting representation, but counting the purpose of that representation sep when you hear an opinion quoted you do no count the number of persons who hold it; you ask, who said that sep  you weigh opinions, you do not count them, and the beauty of all democracies is that every voice can be heard, every voice can have its effect, every voice can contribute to the general judgment that is finally arrived at sep that is the object of democracy sep let us accept what america has always fought for, and accept it with pride that america showed the way and made the proposal sep i do not mean that america made the proposal in this particular instance; i mean that the principle was an american principle, proposed by america sep when you come to the heart of the covenant, my fellow citizens, you will find it in article ten, and i am very much interested to know that the other things have been blown away like bubbles sep there is nothing in the other contentions with regard to the league of nations, but there is something in article ten that you ought to realize and ought to accept or reject sep article ten is the heart of the whole matter sep what is article ten sep i never am certain that i can from memory give a literal repetition of its language, but i am sure that i can give an exact interpretation of its meaning sep article ten provides that every member of the league covenants to respect and preserve the territorial integrity and existing political independence of every other member of the league as against external aggression sep not against internal disturbance sep there was not a man at that table who did not admit the sacredness of the right of self-determination, the sacredness of the right of any body of people to say that they would not continue to live under the government they were then living under, and under article eleven of the covenant they are given a place to say whether they will live under it or not sep for following article ten is article eleven, which makes it the right of any member of the league at any time to call attention to anything, anywhere, that is likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding between nations upon which the peace of the world depends sep i want to give you an illustration of what that would mean sep you have heard a great deal -- something that was true and a great deal that was false--about the provision of the treaty which hands over to japan the rights which germany enjoyed in the province of shantung in china sep in the first place, germany did not enjoy any rights there that other nations had not already claimed sep for my part, my judgment, my moral judgment, is against the whole set of concessions sep they were all of them unjust to china, they ought never to have been exacted, they were all exacted by duress, from a great body of thoughtful and ancient and helpless people sep there never was any right in any of them sep thank god, america never asked for any, never dreamed of asking for any sep but when germany got this concession in 1898, the government of the united states made no protest whatever sep that was not because the government of the united states was not in the hands of thigh-minded and conscientious men sep it was sep william mckinley was president and john hay was secretary of state -- as safe hands to leave the honor of the united states in as any that you can cite sep they made no protest because the state of international law a that time was that it was none of their business unless they could show that the interests of the united states were affected, and the only think that they could show with regard to the interests of the united states was that germany might close the doors of shantung province against the trade of the united states sep they, therefore, demanded and obtained promises that we could continue to sell merchandise in shantung sep immediately following that concession to germany there was a concession to russia of the same sort, of port arthur, and port arthur was handed over subsequently to japan on the very territory of the united states sep dont you remember that when russia and japan got into war with one another the war was brought to a confusion by a treaty written at portsmouth, n sep h sep , and in that treaty without the slightest intimation from any authoritative sources in america that the government of the united states had any objection, port arthur, chinese territory, was turned over to japan sep i want you distinctly to understand that there is no thought of criticism in my mind sep i am expounding to you a state of international law sep now, read articles ten and eleven sep you will see that international law is revolutionized by putting morals into it sep article ten says that no member of the league, and that includes all these nations that have demanded these things unjustly of china, shall impair the territorial integrity or the political independence of any other member of the league sep china is going to be a member of the league sep article eleven says that nay member of the league can call attention to anything that is likely to disturb the peace of the world or the good understanding between nations, and china is for the first time in the history of mankind afforded a standing before the jury of the world sep i, for my part, have a profound sympathy for china, and i am proud to have taken part in an arrangement which promises the protection of the world to the rights o china sep the whole atmosphere of the world is changed by a thing like that, my fellow citizens sep the whole international practice of the world is revolutionized sep but, you will say, what is the second sentence of article ten sep that is what gives very disturbing thoughts sep  the second sentence is that the council of the league shall advise what steps, if any, are necessary to carry out the guaranty of the first sentence, namely, that the members will respect and preserve the territorial integrity and political independence of the other members sep i do not know any other meaning for the word advise except advise sep  the council advises, and it cannot advise without the vote of the united states sep why gentlemen should fear that the congress of the united states would be advised to do something that it did not want to do i frankly cannot imagine, because they cannot even be advised to do anything unless their own representative has participated in the advice sep it may be that that will impair somewhat the vigor of the league, but, nevertheless, the fact is so, that we are not obliged to take any advice except our own, which to any man who wants to go his own course is a very satisfactory state of affairs sep every man regards his own advice as best, and i dare say every man mixes his own advice with some thought of his own interest sep whether we use it wisely or unwisely, we can use the vote of the united states to make impossible drawing the united states into any enterprise that she does not care to be drawn into sep yet article ten strikes at the taproot of war sep article ten is a statement that the very things that have always been sought in imperialistic wars are henceforth foregone by every ambitious nation in the world sep i would have felt very much disturbed if, sitting at the peace table in paris, i had supposed that i was expounding my own ideas sep whether you believe it or not, i know the relative size of my own ideas; i know how they stand related in bulk and proportion to the moral judgments of my fellow countrymen, and i proposed nothing whatever at the peace table at paris that i had not sufficiently certain knowledge embodied the moral judgment of the citizens of the united states sep i had gone over there with, so to say, explicit instruction sep dont you remember that we laid down fourteen points which should contain the principles of the settlement sep they were not my points sep in every one of them i was conscientiously trying to read the thought of the people of the united states, and after i uttered those points i had every assurance given me that could be given me that they did speak the moral judgment of the united states and not my single judgment sep then when it came to that critical period just a little less than a year ago, when it was evident that the war was coming to its critical end, all the nations engaged in the war accepted those fourteen principles explicitly as the basis of the armistice and the basis of the peace sep in those circumstances i crossed the ocean under bond to my own people and to the other governments with which i was dealing sep the whole specification of the method of settlement was written down and accepted before hand, and we were architects building on those specifications sep it reassures me and fortifies my position to find how before i went over men whose judgment the united states has often trusted were of exactly the same opinion that i went abroad to express sep here is something i want to read from theodore roosevelt: the one effective move for obtaining peace is by an agreement among all the great powers in which each should pledge itself no only to abide by the decisions of a common tribunal but to back its decisions by force sep the great civilized nations should combine by solemn agreement in a great would league for the peace of righteousness; a court should be established sep a changed and amplified hague court would meet the requirements, composed of representatives from each nation, whose representatives are sworn to act as judges in each case and not in a representative capacity sep  now there is article ten sep he goes on and says this: the nations should agree on certain rights that should not be questioned, such as territorial integrity, their right to deal with their domestic affairs, and with such matters as whom they should admit to citizenship sep all such guarantee each of their number in possession of these rights sep now, the other specification is the covenant sep the covenant in another portion guarantees to the members the independent control of their domestic questions sep there is not a leg of these gentlemen to stand on when they say that the interests of the united states are not safeguarded in the very points where we are most sensitive sep you do not need to be told again that the covenant expressly says that nothing in this covenant shall be construed as affecting the validity of the monroe doctrine for example sep you could not be more explicit than that sep and every point of interest is covered, partly for one very interesting reason sep this is not the first time that the foreign relations committee of the senate of the united states ahs read and considered this covenant sep i bought it to this country in march last in a tentative, provisional form, in practically the form that it now has, with the exception of certain additions which i shall mention immediately sep i asked the foreign relations committees of both houses to come to the white house and we spent a long evening in the frankest discussion of every portion that they wished to discuss sep they made certain specific suggestions as to what should be contained in this document when it was to be revised sep i carried those suggestions to paris, and every one of them was adopted sep what more could i have done sep what more could have been obtained sep the very matters upon which these gentlemen were most concerned were, the right of withdrawal, which is now expressly stated; the safeguarding of the monroe doctrine, whish is now accomplished/; the exclusion from action by the league of domestic questions, which is now accomplished sep all along the line, every suggestion of the united states was adopted after the covenant had been drawn up in its first form and had been published of the criticism of the world sep there is a very true sense in which i can say this is a tested american document sep i am dwelling upon these points, my fellow citizens, in spite of the fact that i dare say to most of you they are perfectly well know, because in order to meet the present situation we have go to know what we are dealing with sep we are not dealing with the kind of document which this is represented by some gentlemen to be; and inasmuch as we are dealing with a document simon-pure in respect of the very principles we have professed and lived up to, we have got to do one or other of two things -- we have go to adopt it or reject it sep there is no middle course sep you cannot go in on a special-privilege basis of your own sep i take it that you are too proud to ask to be exempted from responsibilities which the other members of the league will carry sep we go in upon equal terms or we do not go in at all; and if we do not go in, my fellow citizens, think of the tragedy of that result -- the only sufficient guaranty to the peace of the world withheld sep ourselves drawn apart with that dangerous pride which means that we shall be ready to take care of ourselves, and that means that we shall maintain great standing armies and an irresistible envy; that means we shall have the organization of a military nation; that means we shall have a general staff, with the kind of power that the general staff of germany had; to mobilize this great manhood of the nation when it pleases, all the energy of our young men drawn into the thought and preparation for war sep what of our pledges to the men that lie dead in france sep we said that they went over there not to prove the prowess of america or her readiness for another war but to see to tit hat there never was such a war again sep it always seems to make it difficult for me to say anything my fellow citizens, when i think of my clients in this case sep my clients are the children; my clients are the next generation sep they do not know what promises and bonds i undertook when i ordered the armies of the united states to the soil of france, but i know, and i intend to redeem my pledges to the children; they shall not be sent upon a similar errand sep again and again, my fellow citizens, mothers who lost their sons in france have come to me and, taking my hand, have shed tears upon it not only, but they added, god
ESFJ	fans, for the past two weeks you have been reading about a bad break i got sep yet today i consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the earth sep i have been in ballparks for seventeen years and have never received anything but kindness and encouragement from you fans sep look at these grand men sep which of you wouldnt consider it the highlight of his career just to associate with them for even one day sep sure im lucky sep who wouldnt consider it an honor to have known jacob ruppert sep also, the builder of baseballs greatest empire, ed barrow sep to have spent six years with that wonderful little fellow, miller huggins sep then to have spent the next nine years with that outstanding leader, that smart student of psychology, the best manager in baseball today, joe mccarthy sep sure im lucky sep when the new york giants,
ISTJ	good evening, my fellow americans sep ten days ago, in my report to the nation on vietnam, i announced the decision to withdraw an additional 150,000 americans from vietnam over the next year sep i said then that i was making that decision despite our concern over increased enemy activity in laos, in cambodia, and in south vietnam sep and at that time i warned that if i concluded that increased enemy activity in any of these areas endangered the lives of americans remaining in vietnam, i would not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that situation sep despite that warning, north vietnam has increased its military aggression in all these areas, and particularly in cambodia sep after full consultation with the national security council, ambassador bunker, general abrams and my other advisors, i have concluded that the actions of the enemy in the last 10 days clearly endanger the lives of americans who are in vietnam now and would constitute an unacceptable risk to those who will be there after withdrawal of another 150,000 sep to protect our men who are in vietnam, and to guarantee the continued success of our withdrawal and vietnamization program, i have concluded that the time has come for action sep tonight, i shall describe the actions of the enemy, the actions i have ordered to deal with that situation, and the reasons for my decision sep cambodia -- a small country of seven million people -- has been a neutral nation since the geneva agreement of 1954, an agreement, incidentally, which was signed by the government of north vietnam sep american policy since then has been to scrupulously respect the neutrality of the cambodian people sep we have maintained a skeleton diplomatic mission of fewer than 15 in cambodias capital, and that only since last august sep for the previous four years, from 1965 to 1969, we did not have any diplomatic mission whatever in cambodia, and for the past five years we have provided no military assistance whatever and no economic assistance to cambodia sep north vietnam, however, has not respected that neutrality sep for the past five years, as indicated on this map, that you see here, north vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries all along the cambodian frontier with south vietnam sep some of these extend up to 20 miles into cambodia sep the sanctuaries are in red, and as you note, they are on both sides of the border sep they are used for hit-and-run attacks on american and south vietnamese forces in south vietnam sep these communist-occupied territories contain major base camps, training sites, logistics facilities, weapons and ammunition factories, airstrips, and prisoner of war compounds sep and for five years neither the united states nor south vietnam has moved against these enemy sanctuaries because we did not wish to violate the territory of a neutral nation sep even after the vietnamese communists began to expand these sanctuaries four weeks ago, we counseled patience to our south vietnamese allies and imposed restraints on our own commanders sep in contrast to our policy the enemy in the past two weeks has stepped up his guerrilla actions, and he is concentrating his main forces in these sanctuaries that you see in this map, where they are building up to launch massive attacks on our forces and those of south vietnam sep north vietnam in the last two weeks has stripped away all pretense of respecting the sovereignty or the neutrality of cambodia sep thousands of their soldiers are invading the country from the sanctuaries sep they are encircling the capital of pnompenh sep coming from these sanctuaries, as you see here, they had moved into cambodia and are encircling the capital sep cambodia, as a result of this, has sent out a call to the united states, to a number of other nations, for assistance sep because if this enemy effort succeeds, cambodia would become a vast enemy staging area and a springboard for attacks on south vietnam along 600 miles of frontier: a refuge where enemy troops could return from combat without fear of retaliation sep north vietnamese men and supplies could then be poured into that country, jeopardizing not only the lives of our own men but the people of south vietnam as well sep now confronted with this situation we had three options: first, we can do nothing sep well the ultimate result of that course of action is clear sep unless we indulge in wishful thinking, the lives of americans remaining in vietnam after our next withdrawal of 150,000 would be gravely threatened sep let us go to the map again sep here is south vietnam sep here is north vietnam sep north vietnam already occupies this part of laos sep if north vietnam also occupied this whole band in cambodia, or the entire country, it would mean that south vietnam was completely outflanked and the forces of americans in this area as well as the south vietnamese would be in an untenable military position sep our second choice is to provide massive military assistance to cambodia itself sep now unfortunately, while we deeply sympathize with the plight of seven million cambodians whose country has been invaded, massive amounts of military assistance could not be rapidly and effectively utilized by this small cambodian army against the immediate trap sep with other nations we shall do our best to provide the small arms and other equipment which the cambodian army of 40,000 needs and can use for its defense sep but the aid we will provide will be limited for the purpose of enabling cambodia to defend its neutrality and not for the purpose of making it an active belligerent on one side or the other sep our third choice is to go to the heart of the trouble sep and that means cleaning out major north vietnamese and vietcong occupied territories, these sanctuaries which serve as bases for attacks on both cambodia and american and south vietnamese forces in south vietnam sep some of these, incidentally, are as close to saigon as baltimore is to washington sep this one, for example, is called the parrots beak sep its only 33 miles from saigon sep now faced with these three options, this is the decision i have made sep in co-operation with the armed forces of south vietnam, attacks are being launched this week to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the cambodian-vietnam border sep a major responsibility for the ground operations is being assumed by south vietnamese forces sep for example, the attacks in several areas, including the parrots beak that i referred to a moment ago, are exclusively south vietnamese ground operations, under south vietnamese command, with the united states providing air and logistical support sep there is one area however, immediately above the parrots beak where i have concluded that a combined american and south vietnamese operation is necessary sep tonight, american and south vietnamese units will attack the headquarters for the entire communist military operation in south vietnam sep this key control center has been occupied by the north vietnamese and vietcong for five years in blatant violation of cambodias neutrality sep this is not an invasion of cambodia sep the areas in which these attacks will be launched are completely occupied and controlled by north vietnamese forces sep our purpose is not to occupy the areas sep once enemy forces are driven out of these sanctuaries, and once their military supplies are destroyed, we will withdraw sep these actions are in no way directed to the security interests of any nation sep any government that chooses to use these actions as a pretext for harming relations with the united states will be doing so on its own responsibility and on its own initiative, and we will draw the appropriate conclusions sep and now, let me give you the reasons for my decision sep a majority of the american people, a majority of you listening to me are for the withdrawal of our forces from vietnam sep the action i have taken tonight is indispensable for the continuing success of that withdrawal program sep a majority of the american people want to end this war rather than to have it drag on interminably sep the action i have taken tonight will serve that purpose sep a majority of the american people want to keep the casualties of our brave men in vietnam at an absolute minimum sep the action i take tonight is essential if we are to accomplish that goal sep we take this action not for the purpose of expanding the war into cambodia, but for the purpose of ending the war in vietnam, and winning the just peace we all desire sep we have made, we will continue to make every possible effort to end this war through negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting in the battlefield sep lets look again at the record sep we stopped the bombing of north vietnam sep we have cut air operations by over 20 per cent sep weve announced the withdrawal of over 250, 000 of our men sep weve offered to withdraw all of our men if they will withdraw theirs sep weve offered to negotiate all issues with only one condition: and that is that the future of south vietnam be determined, not by north vietnam, and not by the united states, but by the people of south vietnam themselves sep the answer of the enemy has been intransigence at the conference table, belligerence at hanoi, massive military aggression in laos and cambodia and stepped-up attacks in south vietnam designed to increase american casualties sep this attitude has become intolerable sep we will not react to this threat to american lives merely by plaintive, diplomatic protests sep if we did, the credibility of the united states would be destroyed in every area of the world where only the power of the united states deters aggression sep tonight, i again warn the north vietnamese that if they continue to escalate the fighting when the united states is withdrawing its forces, i shall meet my responsibility as commander in chief of our armed forces to take the action i consider necessary to defend the security of our american men sep the action i have announced tonight puts the leaders of north vietnam on notice that we will be patient in working for peace sep we will be conciliatory at the conference table sep but we will not be humiliated sep we will not be defeated sep we will not allow american men, by the thousands, to be killed by an enemy from privileged sanctuaries sep the time came long ago to end this war through peaceful negotiations sep we stand ready for those negotiations sep weve made major efforts, many of which must remain secret sep i say tonight all the offers and approaches made previously remain on the conference table whenever hanoi is ready to negotiate seriously sep but if the enemy response to our most conciliatory offers for peaceful negotiation continues to be to increase its attacks and humiliate and defeat us, we shall react accordingly sep my fellow americans, we live in an age of anarchy, both abroad and at home sep we see mindless attacks on all the great institutions which have been created by free civilizations in the last 500 years sep even here in the united states, great universities are being systematically destroyed sep small nations all over the world find themselves under attack from within and from without sep if, when the chips are down, the worlds most powerful nation -- the united states of america -- acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world sep it is not our power, but our will and character that is being tested tonight sep the question all americans must ask and answer tonight is this: does the richest and strongest nation in the history of the world have the character to meet a direct challenge by a group which rejects every effort to win a just peace, ignores our warning, tramples on solemn agreements, violates the neutrality of an unarmed people, and uses our prisoners as hostages sep if we fail to meet this challenge, all other nations will be on notice that despite its overwhelming power the united states when a real crisis comes will be found wanting sep during my campaign for the presidency, i pledged to bring americans home form vietnam sep they are coming home sep i promised to end this war sep i shall keep that promise sep i promised to win a just peace sep i shall keep that promise sep we shall avoid a wider war, but we are also determined to put an end to this war sep in this room, woodrow wilson made the great decisions which led to victory in world war i sep franklin roosevelt made the decisions which led to our victory in world war ii sep dwight d sep eisenhower made decisions which ended the war in korea and avoided war in the middle east sep john f sep kennedy, in his finest hour, made the great decision which removed soviet nuclear missiles from cuba and the western hemisphere sep i have noted that theres been a great deal of discussion with regard to this decision that i have made sep and i should point out i do not contend that it is in the same magnitude as these decisions that i have just mentioned sep but between those decisions and this decision, t
ESTP	thanks very much, barbara mikulski, for your very eloquent, your eloquent introduction sep distinguished legislator, great spokeswoman for economic democracy and social justice in this country, i thank you for your eloquent introduction sep well, things worked out a little different from the way i thought, but let me tell you, i still love new york sep my fellow democrats and my fellow americans, i have come here tonight not to argue as a candidate but to affirm a cause sep i'm asking you -- i am asking you to renew the commitment of the democratic party to economic justice sep i am asking you to renew our commitment to a fair and lasting prosperity that can put america back to work sep this is the cause that brought me into the campaign and that sustained me for nine months across a 100,000 miles in 40 different states sep we had our losses, but the pain of our defeats is far, far less than the pain of the people that i have met sep we have learned that it is important to take issues seriously, but never to take ourselves too seriously sep the serious issue before us tonight is the cause for which the democratic party has stood in its finest hours, the cause that keeps our party young and makes it, in the second century of its age, the largest political party in this republic and the longest lasting political party on this planet sep our cause has been, since the days of thomas jefferson, the cause of the common man and the common woman sep our commitment has been, since the days of andrew jackson, to all those he called "the humble members of society -- the farmers, mechanics, and laborers sep " on this foundation we have defined our values, refined our policies, and refreshed our faith sep now i take the unusual step of carrying the cause and the commitment of my campaign personally to our national convention sep i speak out of a deep sense of urgency about the anguish and anxiety i have seen across america sep i speak out of a deep belief in the ideals of the democratic party, and in the potential of that party and of a president to make a difference sep and i speak out of a deep trust in our capacity to proceed with boldness and a common vision that will feel and heal the suffering of our time and the divisions of our party sep the economic plank of this platform on its face concerns only material things, but it is also a moral issue that i raise tonight sep it has taken many forms over many years sep in this campaign and in this country that we seek to lead, the challenge in 1980 is to give our voice and our vote for these fundamental democratic principles sep let us pledge that we will never misuse unemployment, high interest rates, and human misery as false weapons against inflation sep let us pledge that employment will be the first priority of our economic policy sep let us pledge that there will be security for all those who are now at work, and let us pledge that there will be jobs for all who are out of work; and we will not compromise on the issues of jobs sep these are not simplistic pledges sep simply put, they are the heart of our tradition, and they have been the soul of our party across the generations sep it is the glory and the greatness of our tradition to speak for those who have no voice, to remember those who are forgotten, to respond to the frustrations and fulfill the aspirations of all americans seeking a better life in a better land sep we dare not forsake that tradition sep we cannot let the great purposes of the democratic party become the bygone passages of history sep we must not permit the republicans to seize and run on the slogans of prosperity sep we heard the orators at their convention all trying to talk like democrats sep they proved that even republican nominees can quote franklin roosevelt to their own purpose sep the grand old party thinks it has found a great new trick, but 40 years ago an earlier generation of republicans attempted the same trick sep and franklin roosevelt himself replied, "most republican leaders have bitterly fought and blocked the forward surge of average men and women in their pursuit of happiness sep let us not be deluded that overnight those leaders have suddenly become the friends of average men and women sep ""you know," he continued, "very few of us are that gullible sep " and four years later when the republicans tried that trick again, franklin roosevelt asked, "can the old guard pass itself off as the new deal sep i think not sep we have all seen many marvelous stunts in the circus, but no performing elephant could turn a handspring without falling flat on its back sep "the 1980 republican convention was awash with crocodile tears for our economic distress, but it is by their long record and not their recent words that you shall know them sep the same republicans who are talking about the crisis of unemployment have nominated a man who once said, and i quote, "unemployment insurance is a prepaid vacation plan for freeloaders sep " and that nominee is no friend of labor sep the same republicans who are talking about the problems of the inner cities have nominated a man who said, and i quote, "i have included in my morning and evening prayers every day the prayer that the federal government not bail out new york sep " and that nominee is no friend of this city and our great urban centers across this nation sep the same republicans who are talking about security for the elderly have nominated a man who said just four years ago that "participation in social security should be made voluntary sep " and that nominee is no friend of the senior citizens of this nation sep the same republicans who are talking about preserving the environment have nominated a man who last year made the preposterous statement, and i quote, "eighty percent of our air pollution comes from plants and trees sep " and that nominee is no friend of the environment sep and the same republicans who are invoking franklin roosevelt have nominated a man who said in 1976, and these are his exact words, "fascism was really the basis of the new deal sep " and that nominee whose name is ronald reagan has no right to quote franklin delano roosevelt sep the great adventures which our opponents offer is a voyage into the past sep progress is our heritage, not theirs sep what is right for us as democrats is also the right way for democrats to win sep the commitment i seek is not to outworn views but to old values that will never wear out sep programs may sometimes become obsolete, but the ideal of fairness always endures sep circumstances may change, but the work of compassion must continue sep it is surely correct that we cannot solve problems by throwing money at them, but it is also correct that we dare not throw out our national problems onto a scrap heap of inattention and indifference sep the poor may be out of political fashion, but they are not without human needs sep the middle class may be angry, but they have not lost the dream that all americans can advance together sep the demand of our people in 1980 is not for smaller government or bigger government but for better government sep some say that government is always bad and that spending for basic social programs is the root of our economic evils sep but we reply: the present inflation and recession cost our economy 200 billion dollars a year sep we reply: inflation and unemployment are the biggest spenders of all sep the task of leadership in 1980 is not to parade scapegoats or to seek refuge in reaction, but to match our power to the possibilities of progress sep while others talked of free enterprise, it was the democratic party that acted and we ended excessive regulation in the airline and trucking industry, and we restored competition to the marketplace sep and i take some satisfaction that this deregulation legislation that i sponsored and passed in the congress of the united states sep as democrats we recognize that each generation of americans has a rendezvous with a different reality sep the answers of one generation become the questions of the next generation sep but there is a guiding star in the american firmament sep it is as old as the revolutionary belief that all people are created equal, and as clear as the contemporary condition of liberty city and the south bronx sep again and again democratic leaders have followed that star and they have given new meaning to the old values of liberty and justice for all sep we are the party -- we are the party of the new freedom, the new deal, and the new frontier sep we have always been the party of hope sep so this year let us offer new hope, new hope to an america uncertain about the present, but unsurpassed in its potential for the future sep to all those who are idle in the cities and industries of america let us provide new hope for the dignity of useful work sep democrats have always believed that a basic civil right of all americans is that their right to earn their own way sep the party of the people must always be the party of full employment sep to all those who doubt the future of our economy, let us provide new hope for the reindustrialization of america sep and let our vision reach beyond the next election or the next year to a new generation of prosperity sep if we could rebuild germany and japan after world war ii, then surely we can reindustrialize our own nation and revive our inner cities in the 1980's sep to all those who work hard for a living wage let us provide new hope that their price of their employment shall not be an unsafe workplace and a death at an earlier age sep to all those who inhabit our land from california to the new york island, from the redwood forest to the gulf stream waters, let us provide new hope that prosperity shall not be purchased by poisoning the air, the rivers, and the natural resources that are the greatest gift of this continent sep we must insist that our children and our grandchildren shall inherit a land which they can truly call america the beautiful sep to all those who see the worth of their work and their savings taken by inflation, let us offer new hope for a stable economy sep we must meet the pressures of the present by invoking the full power of government to master increasing prices sep in candor, we must say that the federal budget can be balanced only by policies that bring us to a balanced prosperity of full employment and price restraint sep and to all those overburdened by an unfair tax structure, let us provide new hope for real tax reform sep instead of shutting down classrooms, let us shut off tax shelters sep instead of cutting out school lunches, let us cut off tax subsidies for expensive business lunches that are nothing more than food stamps for the rich sep the tax cut of our republican opponents takes the name of tax reform in vain sep it is a wonderfully republican idea that would redistribute income in the wrong direction sep it's good news for any of you with incomes over 200,000 dollars a year sep for the few of you, it offers a pot of gold worth 14,000 dollars sep but the republican tax cut is bad news for the middle income families sep for the many of you, they plan a pittance of 200 dollars a year, and that is not what the democratic party means when we say tax reform sep the vast majority of americans cannot afford this panacea from a republican nominee who has denounced the progressive income tax as the invention of karl marx sep i am afraid he has confused karl marx with theodore roosevelt -- that obscure republican president who sought and fought for a tax system based on ability to pay sep theodore roosevelt was not karl marx, and the republican tax scheme is not tax reform sep finally, we cannot have a fair prosperity in isolation from a fair society sep so i will continue to stand for a national health insurance sep we must -- we must not surrender -- we must not surrender to the relentless medical inflation that can bankrupt almost anyone and that may soon break the budgets of government at every level sep let us insist on real controls over what doctors and hospitals can charge, and let us resolve that the state of a family's health shall never depend on the size of a family's wealth sep the president, the vice president, the members of congress have a medical plan that meets their needs in full, and whenever senators and representatives catch a little cold, the capitol physician will see them immediately, treat them promptly, fill a prescription on the spot sep we do not get a bill even if we ask for it, and when do you think was the last time a member of congress asked for a bill from the federal government sep and i say again, as i have before, if health insurance is good enough for the president, the vice president, the congress of the united states, then it's good enough for you and every family in america sep there were some -- there were some who said we should be silent about our differences on issues during this convention, but the heritage of the democratic party has been a history of democracy sep we fight hard because we care deeply about our principles and purposes sep we did not flee this struggle sep we welcome the contrast with the empty and expedient spectacle last month in detroit where no nomination was contested, no question was debated, and no one dared to raise any doubt or dissent sep democrats can be proud that we chose a different course and a different platform sep we can be proud that our party stands for investment in safe energy, instead of a nuclear future that may threaten the future itself sep we must not permit the neighborhoods of america to be permanently shadowed by the fear of another three mile island sep we can be proud that our party stands for a fair housing law to unlock the doors of discrimination once and for all sep the american house will be divided against itself so long as there is prejudice against any american buying or renting a home sep and we can be proud that our party stands plainly and publicly and persistently for the ratification of the equal rights amendment sep women hold their rightful place at our convention, and women must have their rightful place in the constitution of the united states sep on this issue we will not yield; we will not equivocate; we will not rationalize, explain, or excuse sep we will stand for e sep r sep a sep and for the recognition at long last that our nation was made up of founding mothers as well as founding fathers sep a fair prosperity and a just society are within our vision and our grasp, and we do not have every answer sep there are questions not yet asked, waiting for us in the recesses of the future sep but of this much we can be certain because it is the lesson of all of our history: together a president and the people can make a difference sep i have found that faith still alive wherever i have traveled across this land sep so let us reject the counsel of retreat and the call to reaction sep let us go forward in the knowledge that history only helps those who help themselves sep there will be setbacks and sacrifices in the years ahead; but i am convinced that we as a people are ready to give something back to our country in return for all it has given to us sep let this -- let this be our commitment: whatever sacrifices must be made will be shared and shared fairly sep and let this be our confidence: at the end of our journey and always before us shines that ideal of liberty and justice for all sep in closing, let me say a few words to all those that i have met and to all those who have supported me at this convention and across the country sep there were hard hours on our journey, and often we sailed against the wind sep but always we kept our rudder true, and there were so many of you who stayed the course and shared our hope sep you gave your help; but even more, you gave your hearts sep and because of you, this has been a happy campaign sep you welcomed joan, me, and our family into your homes and neighborhoods, your churches, your campuses, your union halls sep and when i think back of all the miles and all the months and all the memories, i think of you sep and i recall the poet's words, and i say: "what golden friends i had sep "among you, my golden friends across this land, i have listened and learned sep i have listened to kenny dubois, a glassblower in charleston, west virginia, who has ten children to support but has lost his job after 35 years, just three years short of qualifying for his pension sep i have listened to the trachta family who farm in iowa and who wonder whether they can pass the good life and the good earth on to their children sep i have listened to the grandmother in east oakland who no longer has a phone to call her grandchildren because she gave it up to pay the rent on her small apartment sep i have listened to young workers out of work, to students without the tuition for college, and to families without the chance to own a home sep i have seen the closed factories and the stalled assembly lines of anderson, indiana and south gate, california, and i have seen too many, far too many idle men and women desperate to work sep i have seen too many, far too many working families desperate to protect the value of their wages from the ravages of inflation sep yet i have also sensed a yearning for a new hope among the people in every state where i have been sep and i have felt it in their handshakes, i saw it in their faces, and i shall never forget the mothers who carried children to our rallies sep i shall always remember the elderly who have lived in an america of high purpose and who believe that it can all happen again sep tonight, in their name, i have come here to speak for them sep and for their sake, i ask you to stand with them sep on their behalf i ask you to restate and reaffirm the timeless truth of our party sep i congratulate president carter on his victory here sep i am -- i am confident that the democratic party will reunite on the basis of democratic principles, and that together we will march towards a democratic victory in 1980 sep and someday, long after this convention, long after the signs come down and the crowds stop cheering, and the bands stop playing, may it be said of our campaign that we kept the faith sep may it be said of our party in 1980 that we found our faith again sep and may it be said of us, both in dark passages and in bright days, in the words of tennyson that my brothers quoted and loved, and that have special meaning for me now: "i am a part of all that i have metto [tho] much is taken, much abidesthat which we are, we are --one equal temper of heroic heartsstrong in willto strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield sep "for me, a few hours ago, this campaign came to an end sep for all those whose cares have been our concern, the work goes on, the cause endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never die
ESTJ	good evening, my fellow americans: tonight i want to speak to you of peace in vietnam and southeast asia sep no other question so preoccupies our people sep no other dream so absorbs the 250 million human beings who live in that part of the world sep no other goal motivates american policy in southeast asia sep for years, representatives of our governments and others have traveled the world seeking to find a basis for peace talks sep since last september they have carried the offer that i made public at san antonio sep and that offer was this: that the united states would stop its bombardment of north vietnam when that would lead promptly to productive discussions -- and that we would assume that north vietnam would not take military advantage of our restraint sep hanoi denounced this offer, both privately and publicly sep even while the search for peace was going on, north vietnam rushed their preparations for a savage assault on the people, the government, and the allies of south vietnam sep their attack -- during the tet holidays -- failed to achieve its principal objectives sep it did not collapse the elected government of south vietnam or shatter its army -- as the communists had hoped sep it did not produce a "general uprising" among the people of the cities, as they had predicted sep the communists were unable to maintain control of any of the more than 30 cities that they attacked sep and they took very heavy casualties sep but they did compel the south vietnamese and their allies to move certain forces from the countryside into the cities sep they caused widespread disruption and suffering sep their attacks, and the battles that followed, made refugees of half a million human beings sep the communists may renew their attack any day sep they are, it appears, trying to make 1968 the year of decision in south vietnam -- the year that brings, if not final victory or defeat, at least a turning point in the struggle sep this much is clear: if they do mount another round of heavy attacks, they will not succeed in destroying the fighting power of south vietnam and its allies sep but tragically, this is also clear: many men -- on both sides of the struggle -- will be lost sep a nation that has already suffered 20 years of warfare will suffer once again sep armies on both sides will take new casualties sep and the war will go on sep there is no need for this to be so sep there is no need to delay the talks that could bring an end to this long and this bloody war sep tonight, i renew the offer i made last august: to stop the bombardment of north vietnam sep we ask that talks begin promptly, that they be serious talks on the substance of peace sep we assume that during those talks hanoi will not take advantage of our restraint sep we are prepared to move immediately toward peace through negotiations sep so tonight, in the hope that this action will lead to early talks, i am taking the first step to de-escalate the conflict sep we are reducing -- substantially reducing -- the present level of hostilities, and we are doing so unilaterally and at once sep tonight, i have ordered our aircraft and our naval vessels to make no attacks on north vietnam, except in the area north of the demilitarized zone where the continuing enemy buildup directly threatens allied forward positions and where the movements of their troops and supplies are clearly related to that threat sep the area in which we are stopping our attacks includes almost 90 percent of north vietnam's population, and most of its territory sep thus, there will be no attacks around the principal populated areas, or in the food-producing areas of north vietnam sep even this very limited bombing of the north could come to an early end -- if our restraint is matched by restraint in hanoi sep but i cannot in good conscience stop all bombing so long as to do so would immediately and directly endanger the lives of our men and our allies sep whether a complete bombing halt becomes possible in the future will be determined by events sep our purpose in this action is to bring about a reduction in the level of violence that now exists sep it is to save the lives of brave men --and to save the lives of innocent women and children sep it is to permit the contending forces to move closer to a political settlement sep and tonight i call upon the united kingdom and i call upon the soviet union -- as co-chairmen of the geneva conferences, and as permanent members of the united nations security council -- to do all they can to move from the unilateral act of de-escalation that i have just announced toward genuine peace in southeast asia sep now, as in the past, the united states is ready to send its representatives to any forum, at any time, to discuss the means of bringing this ugly war to an end sep i am designating one of our most distinguished americans, ambassador averell harriman, as my personal representative for such talks sep in addition, i have asked ambassador llewellyn thompson, who returned from moscow for consultation, to be available to join ambassador harriman at geneva or any other suitable place -- just as soon as hanoi agrees to a conference sep i call upon president ho chi minh to respond positively, and favorably, to this new step toward peace sep but if peace does not come now through negotiations, it will come when hanoi understands that our common resolve is unshakable, and our common strength is invincible sep tonight, we and the other allied nations are contributing 600,000 fighting men to assist 700,000 south vietnamese troops in defending their little country sep our presence there has always rested on this basic belief: the main burden of preserving their freedom must be carried out by them -- by the south vietnamese themselves sep we and our allies can only help to provide a shield behind which the people of south vietnam can survive and can grow and develop sep on their efforts -- on their determinations and resourcefulness --the outcome will ultimately depend sep that small, beleaguered nation has suffered terrible punishment for more than 20 years sep i pay tribute once again tonight to the great courage and the endurance of its people sep south vietnam supports armed forces tonight of almost 700,000 men, and i call your attention to the fact that that is the equivalent of more than 10 million in our own population sep its people maintain their firm determination to be free of domination by the north sep there has been substantial progress, i think, in building a durable government during these last three years sep the south vietnam of 1965 could not have survived the enemy's tet offensive of 1968 sep the elected government of south vietnam survived that attack -- and is rapidly repairing the devastation that it wrought sep the south vietnamese know that further efforts are going to be required to expand their own armed forces; to move back into the countryside as quickly as possible; to increase their taxes; to select the very best men that they have for civil and military responsibilities; to achieve a new unity within their constitutional government, and to include in the national effort all those groups who wish to preserve south vietnam's control over its own destiny sep last week president thieu ordered the mobilization of 135,000 additional south vietnamese sep he plans to reach as soon as possible a total military strength of more than 800,000 men sep to achieve this, the government of south vietnam started the drafting of 19-year-olds on march 1st sep on may 1st, the government will begin the drafting of 18-year-olds sep last month, 10,000 men volunteered for military service sep that was two and a half times the number of volunteers during the same month last year sep since the middle of january, more than 48,000 south vietnamese have joined the armed forces, and nearly half of them volunteered to do so sep all men in the south vietnamese armed forces have had their tours of duty extended for the duration of the war, and reserves are now being called up for immediate active duty sep president thieu told his people last week, and i quote: we must make greater efforts, we must accept more sacrifices, because as i have said many times, this is our country sep the existence of our nation is at stake, and this is mainly a vietnamese responsibility sep he warned his people that a major national effort is required to root out corruption and incompetence at all levels of government sep we applaud this evidence of determination on the part of south vietnam sep our first priority will be to support their effort sep we shall accelerate the re-equipment of south vietnam's armed forces in order to meet the enemy's increased firepower sep and this will enable them progressively to undertake a larger share of combat operations against the communist invaders sep on many occasions i have told the american people that we would send to vietnam those forces that are required to accomplish our mission there sep so with that as our guide we have previously authorized a force level of approximately 525,000 sep some weeks ago to help meet the enemy's new offensive we sent to vietnam about 11,000 additional marine and airborne troops sep they were deployed by air in 48 hours on an emergency basis sep but the artillery and the tank and the aircraft and medical and other units that were needed to work with and support these infantry troops in combat could not then accompany them by air on that short notice sep in order that these forces may reach maximum combat effectiveness, the joint chiefs of staff have recommended to me that we should prepare to send during the next five months the support troops totaling approximately 13,500 men sep a portion of these men will be made available from our active forces sep the balance will come from reserve component units, which will be called up for service sep the actions that we have taken since the beginning of the year to re-equip the south vietnamese forces; to meet our responsibilities in korea, as well as our responsibilities in vietnam; to meet price increases and the cost of activating and deploying these reserve forces; to replace helicopters and provide the other military supplies we need, all of these actions are going to require additional expenditures sep the tentative estimate of those additional expenditures is 2 1/2 billion dollars in this fiscal year and 2 billion, 600 million in the next fiscal year sep these projected increases in expenditures for our national security will bring into sharper focus the nation's need for immediate action, action to protect the prosperity of the american people and to protect the strength and the stability of our american dollar sep on many occasions i have pointed out that without a tax bill or decreased expenditures, next year's deficit would again be around $20 billion sep i have emphasized the need to set strict priorities in our spending sep i have stressed that failure to act -- and to act promptly and decisively -- would raise very strong doubts throughout the world about america's willingness to keep its financial house in order sep yet congress has not acted sep and tonight we face the sharpest financial threat in the postwar era -- a threat to the dollar's role as the keystone of international trade and finance in the world sep last week, at the monetary conference in stockholm, the major industrial countries decided to take a big step toward creating a new international monetary asset that will strengthen the international monetary system sep and i'm very proud of the very able work done by secretary fowler and chairman martin of the federal reserve board sep but to make this system work, the united states just must bring its balance of payments to -- or very close to -- equilibrium sep we must have a responsible fiscal policy in this country sep the passage of a tax bill now, together with expenditure control that the congress may desire and dictate, is absolutely necessary to protect this nations security, and to continue our prosperity, and to meet the needs of our people sep now, what is at stake is seven years of unparalleled prosperity sep in those seven years, the real income of the average american, after taxes, rose by almost 30 percent -- a gain as large as that of the entire preceding 19 years sep so the steps that we must take to convince the world are exactly the steps that we must take to sustain our own economic strength here at home sep in the past eight months, prices and interest rates have risen because of our inaction sep we must therefore now do everything we can to move from debate to action, from talking to voting and there is, i believe -- i hope there is -- in both houses of the congress a growing sense of urgency that this situation just must be acted upon and must be corrected sep my budget in january, we thought, was a tight one sep it fully reflected our evaluation of most of the demanding needs of this nation sep but in these budgetary matters, the president does not decide alone sep the congress has the power, and the duty, to determine appropriations and taxes sep and the congress is now considering our proposals, and they are considering reductions in the budget that we submitted sep as part of a program of fiscal restraint that includes the tax surcharge, i shall approve appropriate reductions in the january budget when and if congress so decides that that should be done sep one thing is unmistakably clear, however sep our deficit just must be reduced sep failure to act could bring on conditions that would strike hardest at those people that all of us are trying so hard to helpso these times call for prudence in this land of plenty sep and i believe that we have the character to provide it, and tonight i plead with the congress and with the people to act promptly to serve the national interest and thereby serve all of our people sep now let me give you my estimate of the chances for peace -- the peace that will one day stop the bloodshed in south vietnam; that will -- all the vietnamese people [will] be permitted to rebuild and develop their land; that will permit us to turn more fully to our own tasks here at home sep i cannot promise that the initiative that i have announced tonight will be completely successful in achieving peace any more than the 30 others that we have undertaken and agreed to in recent years sep but it is our fervent hope that north vietnam, after years of fighting that has left the issue unresolved, will now cease its efforts to achieve a military victory and will join with us in moving toward the peace table sep and there may come a time when south vietnamese -- on both sides -- are able to work out a way to settle their own differences by free political choice rather than by war sep as hanoi considers its course, it should be in no doubt of our intentions sep it must not miscalculate the pressures within our democracy in this election year sep we have no intention of widening this war sep but the united states will never accept a fake solution to this long and arduous struggle and call it peace sep no one can foretell the precise terms of an eventual settlement sep our objective in south vietnam has never been the annihilation of the enemy sep it has been to bring about a recognition in hanoi that its objective -- taking over the south by force -- could not be achieved sep we think that peace can be based on the geneva accords of 1954, under political conditions that permit the south vietnamese -- all the south vietnamese -- to chart their course free of any outside domination or interference, from us or from anyone else sep so tonight, i reaffirm the pledge that we made at manila: that we are prepared to withdraw our forces from south vietnam as the other side withdraws its forces to the north, stops the infiltration, and the level of violence thus subsides sep our goal of peace and self-determination in vietnam is directly related to the future of all of southeast asia, where much has happened to inspire confidence during the past 10 years sep and we have done all that we knew how to do to contribute and to help build that confidence sep a number of its nations have shown what can be accomplished under conditions of security sep since 1966, indonesia, the fifth largest nation in all the world, with a population of more than 100 million people, has had a government thats dedicated to peace with its neighbors and improved conditions for its own people sep political and economic cooperation between nations has grown rapidly sep and i think every american can take a great deal of pride in the role that we have played in bringing this about in southeast asia sep we can rightly judge -- as responsible southeast asians themselves do -- that the progress of the past three years would have been far less likely, if not completely impossible, if america's sons and others had not made their stand in vietnam sep at johns hopkins university about three years ago, i announced that the united states would take part in the great work of developing southeast asia, including the mekong valley, for all the people of that region sep our determination to help build a better land -- a better land for men on both sides of the present conflict -- has not diminished in the least sep indeed, the ravages of war, i think, have made it more urgent than ever sep so i repeat on behalf of the united states again tonight what i said at johns hopkins -- that north vietnam could take its place in this common effort just as soon as peace comes sep over time, a wider framework of peace and security in southeast asia may become possible sep the new cooperations of the nations of the area could be a foundation stone sep certainly friendship with the nations of such a southeast asia is what the united states seeks -- and that is all that the united states seeks sep one day, my fellow citizen, there will be peace in southeast asia sep it will come because the people of southeast asia want it -- those whose armies are at war tonight; those who, though threatened, have thus far been spared sep peace will come because asians were willing to work for it and to sacrifice for it -- and to die by the thousands for it sep but let it never be forgotten: peace will come also because america sent her sons to help secure it sep it has not been easy -- far from it sep during the past four and a half years, it has been my fate and my responsibility to be commander in chief sep i have lived daily and nightly with the cost of this war sep i know the pain that it has inflicted sep i know perhaps better than anyone the misgivings that it has aroused sep and throughout this entire long period i have been sustained by a single principle: that what we are doing now in vietnam is vital not only to the security of southeast asia, but it is vital to the security of every american sep surely, we have treaties which we must respect sep surely, we have commitments that we are going to keep sep resolutions of the congress testify to the need to resist aggression in the world and in southeast asia sep but the heart of our involveme"t in south vietnam under three different presidents, three separate administrations, has always been america's own security sep and the larger purpose of our involvement has always been to help the nations of southeast asia become independent, and stand alone, self-sustaining as members of a great world community, at peace with themselves, at peace with all others sep and with such a nation our country -- and the world -- will be far more secure than it is tonight sep i believe that a peaceful asia is far nearer to reality because of what america has done in vietnam sep i believe that the men who endure the dangers of battle there, fighting there for us tonight, are helping the entire world avoid far greater conflicts, far wider wars, far more destruction, than this one sep the peace that will bring them home someday will come sep tonight, i have offered the first in what i hope will be a series of mutual moves toward peace sep i pray that it will not be rejected by the leaders of north vietnam sep i pray that they will accept it as a means by which the sacrifices of their own people may be ended sep and i ask your help and your support, my fellow citizens, for this effort to reach across the battlefield toward an early peace sep finally, my fellow americans, let me say this: of those to whom much is given, much is asked sep i cannot say -- and no man could say -- that no more will be asked of us sep yet i believe that now, no less than when the decade began, this "generation of americans" is willing to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, to assure the survival, and the success, of liberty sep "since those words were spoken by john f sep kennedy, the people of america have kept that compact with mankind's noblest cause sep and we shall continue to keep it sep yet, i believe that we must always be mindful of this one thing -- whatever the trials and the tests ahead, the ultimate strength of our country and our cause will lie, not in powerful weapons or infinite resources or boundless wealth, but will lie in the unity of our people sep this i believe very deeply sep throughout my entire public career i have followed the personal philosophy that i am a free man, an american, a public servant, and a member of my party -- in that order -- always and only sep for 37 years in the service of our nation, first as a congressman, as a senator, and as vice president, and now as your president, i have put the unity of the people first sep i have put it ahead of any divisive partisanship sep and in these times as in times before, it is true that a house divided against itself by the spirit of faction, of party, of region, of religion, of race, is a house that cannot stand sep there is division in the american house now sep there is divisiveness among us all tonight sep and holding the trust that is mine, as president of all the people, i cannot disregard the peril to the progress of the american people and the hope and the prospects of peace for all peoples sep so, i would ask all americans, whatever their personal interests or concern, to guard against divisiveness and all of its ugly consequences sep fifty-two months and ten days ago, in a moment of tragedy and trauma, the duties of this office fell upon me sep i asked then for your help and god's, that we might continue america on its course, binding up our wounds, healing our history, moving forward in new unity to clear the american agenda and to keep the american commitment for all of our people sep united we have kept that commitment sep and united we have enlarged that commitment sep and through all time to come i thin
ENTJ	my friends: i count it a privilege to be invited to address the commonwealth club sep it has stood in the life of this city and state, and it is perhaps accurate to add, the nation, as a group of citizen leaders interested in fundamental problems of government, and chiefly concerned with achievement of progress in government through non-partisan means sep the privilege of addressing you, therefore, in the heat of a political campaign, is great sep i want to respond to your courtesy in terms consistent with your policy sep i want to speak not of politics but of government sep i want to speak not of parties, but of universal principles sep they are not political, except in that larger sense in which a great american once expressed a definition of politics, that nothing in all of human life is foreign to the science of politics sep the issue of government has always been whether individual men and women will have to serve some system of government of economics, or whether a system of government and economics exists to serve individual men and women sep this question has persistently dominated the discussion of government for many generations sep on questions relating to these things men have differed, and for time immemorial it is probable that honest men will continue to differ sep the final word belongs to no man; yet we can still believe in change and in progress sep democracy, as a dear old friend of mine in indian, meredith nicholson, has called it, is a quest, a never-ending seeking for better things, and in the seeking for these things and the striving for better things, and in the seeking for these things and the striving for them, there are many roads to follow sep but, if we map the course of these roads, we find that there are only two general directions sep when we look about us, we are likely to forget how hard people have worked to win the privilege of government sep the growth of the national governments of europe was a struggle for the development of a centralized force in the nation, strong enough to impose peace upon ruling barons sep in many instances the victory of the central government, the creation of a strong central government, was a haven of refuge to the individual sep the people preferred the master far away to the exploitation and cruelty of the smaller master near at hand sep but the creators of national government were perforce ruthless men sep they were often cruel in their methods, but they did strive steadily toward something that society needed and very much wanted, a strong central state, able to keep the peace, to stamp out civil war, to put the unruly nobleman in his place, and to permit the bulk of individuals to live safely sep the man of ruthless force had his place in developing a pioneer country, just as he did in fixing the power of the central government in the development of nations sep society paid him well for his services and its development sep when the development among the nations of europe, however, has been completed, ambition, and ruthlessness, having served its term tended to overstep its mark sep there came a growing feeling that government was conducted for the benefit of a few who thrived unduly at the expense of all sep the people sought a balancing -- a limiting force sep there came gradually, through town councils, trade guilds, national parliaments, by constitution and by popular participation and control, limitations on arbitrary power sep another factor that tended to limit the power of those who ruled was the rise of the ethical conception that a ruler bore a responsibility for the welfare of his subjects sep the american colonies were born in this struggle sep the american revolution was a turning point in it sep after the revolution the struggle continued and shaped itself in the public life of the country sep there were those who because they had seen the confusion which attended the years of war for american independence surrendered to the belief that popular government was essentially dangerous and essentially unworkable sep they were honest people, my friends, and we cannot deny that their experience had warranted some measure of fear sep the most brilliant, honest and able exponent of this point of view was hamilton sep he was too impatient of slow moving methods sep fundamentally he believed that the safety of the republic lay in the autocratic strength of its government, that the destiny of individuals was to serve that government, and that fundamentally a great and strong group of central institutions, guided by a small group of able and public spirited citizens could best direct all government sep but mr sep jefferson, in the summer of 1776, after drafting the declaration of independence turned his mind to the same problem and took a different view sep he did not deceive himself with outward forms sep government to him was a means to an end, not an end in itself; it might be either a refuge and a help or a threat and a danger, depending on the circumstances sep we find him carefully analyzing the society for which he was to organize a government: we have no paupers sep the great mass of our population is of laborers, our rich who cannot live without labor, either manual or professional, being few and of moderate wealth sep most of the laboring class possess property, cultivate their own lands, have families and from the demand for their labor, are enabled to exact from the rich and the competent such prices as enable them to feed abundantly, clothe above mere decency, to labor moderately and raise their families sep 1these people, he considered, had two sets of rights, those of personal competency and those involved in acquiring and possessing property sep by personal competency he meant the right of free thinking, freedom of forming and expressing opinions, and freedom of personal living each man according to his own lights sep to insure the first set of rights, a government must so order its functions as not to interfere with the individual sep but even jefferson realized that the exercise of the property rights might so interfere with the rights of the individual that the government, without whose assistance the property rights could not exist, must intervene, not to destroy individualism but to protect it sep you are familiar with the great political duel which followed, and how hamilton, and his friends, building towards a dominant centralized power were at length defeated in the great election of 1800, by mr sep jeffersons party sep out of that duel came the two parties, republican and democratic, as we know them today sep so began, in american political life, the new day, the day of the individual against the system, the day in which individualism was made the great watchword of american life sep the happiest of economic conditions made that day long and splendid sep on the western frontier, land was substantially free sep no one, who did not shirk the task of earning a living, was entirely without opportunity to do so sep depressions could, and did, come and go; but they could not alter the fundamental fact that most of the people lived partly by selling their labor and partly by extracting their livelihood from the soil, so that starvation and dislocation were practically impossible sep at the very worst there was always the possibility of climbing into a covered wagon and moving west where the untilled prairies afforded a haven for men to whom the east did not provide a place sep so great were our natural resources that we could offer this relief not only to our own people, but to the distressed of all the world; we could invite immigration from europe, and welcome it with open arms sep traditionally, when a depression came, a new section of land was opened in the west; and even our temporary misfortune served our manifest destiny sep it was the middle of the 19th century that a new force was released and a new dream created sep the force was what is called the industrial revolution, the advance of steam and machinery and the rise of the forerunners of the modern industrial plant sep the dream was the dream of an economic machine, able to raise the standard of living for everyone; to bring luxury within the reach of the humblest; to annihilate distance by steam power and later by electricity, and to release everyone from the drudgery of the heaviest manual toil sep it was to be expected that this would necessarily affect government sep heretofore, government had merely been called upon to produce conditions within which people could live happily, labor peacefully, and rest secure sep now it was called upon to aid in the consummation of this new dream sep there was, however, a shadow over the dream sep to be made real, it required use of the talents of men of tremendous will, and tremendous ambition, since by no other force could the problems of financing and engineering and new developments be brought to a consummation sep so manifest were the advantages of the machine age, however, that the united states fearlessly, cheerfully, and, i think, rightly, accepted the bitter with the sweet sep it was thought that no price was too high to pay for the advantages which we could draw from a finished industrial system sep the history of the last half century is accordingly in large measure a history of a group of financial titans, whose methods were not scrutinized with too much care, and who were honored in proportion as they produced the results, irrespective of the means they used sep the financiers who pushed the railroads to the pacific were always ruthless, we have them today sep it has been estimated that the american investor paid for the american railway system more than three times over in the process; but despite that fact the net advantage was to the united states sep as long as we had free land; as long as population was growing by leaps and bounds; as long as our industrial plants were insufficient to supply our needs, society chose to give the ambitious man free play and unlimited reward provided only that he produced the economic plant so much desired sep during this period of expansion, there was equal opportunity for all and the business of government was not to interfere but to assist in the development of industry sep this was done at the request of businessmen themselves sep the tariff was originally imposed for the purpose of fostering our infant industry, a phrase i think the older among you will remember as a political issue not so long ago sep the railroads were subsidized, sometimes by grants of money, oftener by grants of land; some of the most valuable oil lands in the united states were granted to assist the financing of the railroad which pushed through the southwest sep a nascent merchant marine was assisted by grants of money, or by mail subsidies, so that our steam shipping might ply the seven seas sep some of my friends tell me that they do not want the government in business sep with this i agree; but i wonder whether they realize the implications of the past sep for while it has been american doctrine that the government must not go into business in competition with private enterprises, still it has been traditional particularly in republican administrations for business urgently to ask the government to put at private disposal all kinds of government assistance sep the same man who tells you that he does not want to see the government interfere in business -- and he means it, and has plenty of good reasons for saying so -- is the first to go to washington and ask the government for a prohibitory tariff on his product sep when things get just bad enough -- as they did two years ago -- he will go with equal speed to the united states government and ask for a loan; and the reconstruction finance corporation is the outcome of it sep each group has sought protection from the government for its own special interest, without realizing that the function of government must be to favor no small group at the expense of its duty to protect the rights of personal freedom and of private property of all its citizens sep in retrospect we can now see that the turn of the tide came with the turn of the century sep we were reaching our last frontier; there was no more free land and our industrial combinations had become great uncontrolled and irresponsible units of power within the state sep clear-sighted men saw with fear the danger that opportunity would no longer be equal; that the growing corporation, like the feudal baron of old, might threaten the economic freedom of individuals to earn a living sep in that hour, our antitrust laws were born sep the cry was raised against the great corporations sep theodore roosevelt, the first great republican progressive, fought a presidential campaign on the issue of trust busting and talked freely about malefactors of great wealth sep if the government had a policy it was rather to turn the clock back, to destroy the large combinations and to return to the time when every man owned his individual small business sep this was impossible; theodore roosevelt, abandoning the idea of trust busting, was forced to work out a difference between good trusts and bad trusts sep the supreme court set forth the famous rule of reason by which it seems to have meant that a concentration of industrial power was permissible if the method by which it got its power, and the use it made of that power, was reasonable sep woodrow wilson, elected in 1912, saw the situation more clearly sep where jefferson had feared the encroachment of political power on the lives of individuals, wilson knew that the new power was financial sep he say, in the highly centralized economic system, the depot of the twentieth century, on whom great masses of individuals relied for their safety and their livelihood, and whose irresponsibility and greed (if it were not controlled) would reduce them to starvation and penury sep the concentration of financial power had not proceeded so far in 1912 as it has today; but it had grown far enough for mr sep wilson to realize fully its implications sep it is interesting, now, to read his speeches sep what is called radical today (and i have reason to know whereof i speak) is mild compared to the campaign of mr sep wilson sep no man can deny, he said,that the lines of endeavor have more and more narrowed and stiffened; no man who knows anything about the development of industry in this country can have failed to observe that the larger kinds of credit are more and more difficult to obtain unless you obtain them upon terms of uniting your efforts with those who already control the industry of the country, and nobody can fail to observe that every man who tries to set himself up in competition with any process of manufacture which has taken place under the control of large combinations of capital will presently find himself either squeezed out or obliged to sell and allow himself to be absorbed sep had there been no world war -- had mr sep wilson been able to devote eight years to domestic instead of to international affairs -- we might have had a wholly different situation at the present time sep however, the then distant roar of european cannon, growing ever louder, forced him to abandon the study of this issue sep the problem he saw so clearly is left with us as a legacy; and no one of us on either side of the political controversy can deny that it is a matter of grave concern to the government sep a glance at the situation today only too clearly indicates that equality of opportunity as we have know it no longer exists sep our industrial plant is built; the problem just now is whether under existing conditions it is not overbuilt sep our last frontier has long since been reached, and there is practically no more free land sep more than half of our people do not live on the farms or on lands and cannot derive a living by cultivating their own property sep there is no safety valve in the form of a western prairie to which those thrown out of work by the eastern economic machines can go for a new start sep we are not able to invite the immigration from europe to share our endless plenty sep we are now providing a drab living for our own people sep our system of constantly rising tariffs has at last reacted against us to the point of closing our canadian frontier on the north, our european markets on the east, many of our latin american markets to the south, and a goodly proportion of our pacific markets on the west, through the retaliatory tariffs of those countries sep it has forced many of our great industrial institutions who exported their surplus production to such countries, to establish plants in such countries within the tariff walls sep this has resulted in the reduction of the operation of their american plants, and opportunity for employment sep just as freedom to farm has ceased, so also the opportunity in business has narrowed sep it still is true that men can start small enterprises, trusting to native shrewdness and ability to keep abreast of competitors; but area after area has been preempted altogether by the great corporations, and even in the fields which still have no great concerns, the small man starts with a handicap sep the unfeeling statistics of the past three decades show that the independent business man is running a losing race sep perhaps he is forced to the wall; perhaps he cannot command credit; perhaps he is squeezed out, in mr sep wilsons words, by highly organized corporate competitors, as your corner grocery man can tell you sep recently a careful study was made of the concentration of business in the united states sep it showed that our economic life was dominated by some six hundred odd corporations who controlled two-thirds of american industry sep ten million small business men divided the other third sep more striking still, it appeared that if the process of concentration goes on at the same rate, at the end of another century we shall have all american industry controlled by a dozen corporations, and run by perhaps a hundred men sep put plainly, we are steering a steady course toward economic oligarchy, if we are not there already sep clearly, all this calls for a reappraisal of values sep a mere builder of more industrial plants, a creator of more railroad systems, and organizer of more corporations, is as likely to be a danger as a help sep the day of the great promoter or the financial titan, to whom we granted anything if only he would build, or develop, is over sep our task now is not discovery or exploitation of natural resources, or necessarily producing more goods sep it is the soberer, less dramatic business of administering resources and plants already in hand, of seeking to reestablish foreign markets for our surplus production, of meeting the problem of under consumption, of adjusting production to consumption, of distributing wealth and products more equitably, of adapting existing economic organizations to the service of the people sep the day of enlightened administration has come sep just as in older times the central government was first a haven of refuge, and then a threat, so now in a closer economic system the central and ambitious financial unit is no longer a servant of national desire, but a danger sep i would draw the parallel one step farther sep we did not think because national government had become a threat in the 18th century that therefore we should abandon the principle of national government sep nor today should we abandon the principle of strong economic units called corporations, merely because their power is susceptible of easy abuse sep in other times we dealt with the problem of an unduly ambitious central government by modifying it gradually into a constitutional democratic government sep so today we are modifying and controlling our economic units sep as i see it, the task of government in its relation to business is to assist the development of an economic declaration of rights, an economic constitutional order sep this is the common task of statesman and business man sep it is the minimum requirement of a more permanently safe order of things sep every man has a right to life; and this means that he has also a right to make a comfortable living sep he may by sloth or crime decline to exercise that right; but it may not be denied him sep we have no actual famine or death; our industrial and agricultural mechanism can produce enough and to spare sep our government formal and informal, political and economic, owes to every one an avenue to possess himself of a portion of that plenty sufficient for his needs, through his own work sep every man has a right to his own property; which means a right to be assured, to the fullest extent attainable, in the safety of his savings sep by no other means can men carry the burdens of those parts of life which, in the nature of things afford no chance of labor;

INTJ	there has been a change of government sep it began two years ago, when the house of representatives became democratic by a decisive majority sep it has now been completed sep the senate about to assemble will also be democratic sep the offices of president and vice-president have been put into the hands of democrats sep what does the change mean sep that is the question that is uppermost in our minds to-day sep that is the question i am going to try to answer, in order, if i may, to interpret the occasion sep it means much more than the mere success of a party sep the success of a party means little except when the nation is using that party for a large and definite purpose sep no one can mistake the purpose for which the nation now seeks to use the democratic party sep it seeks to use it to interpret a change in its own plans and point of view sep some old things with which we had grown familiar, and which had begun to creep into the very habit of our thought and of our lives, have altered their aspect as we have latterly looked critically upon them, with fresh, awakened eyes; have dropped their disguises and shown themselves alien and sinister sep some new things, as we look frankly upon them, willing to comprehend their real character, have come to assume the aspect of things long believed in and familiar, stuff of our own convictions sep we have been refreshed by a new insight into our own life sep we see that in many things that life is very great sep it is incomparably great in its material aspects, in its body of wealth, in the diversity and sweep of its energy, in the industries which have been conceived and built up by the genius of individual men and the limitless enterprise of groups of men sep it is great, also, very great, in its moral force sep nowhere else in the world have noble men and women exhibited in more striking forms the beauty and the energy of sympathy and helpfulness and counsel in their efforts to rectify wrong, alleviate suffering, and set the weak in the way of strength and hope sep we have built up, moreover, a great system of government, which has stood through a long age as in many respects a model for those who seek to set liberty upon foundations that will endure against fortuitous change, against storm and accident sep our life contains every great thing, and contains it in rich abundance sep but the evil has come with the good, and much fine gold has been corroded sep with riches has come inexcusable waste sep we have squandered a great part of what we might have used, and have not stopped to conserve the exceeding bounty of nature, without which our genius for enterprise would have been worthless and impotent, scorning to be careful, shamefully prodigal as well as admirably efficient sep we have been proud of our industrial achievements, but we have not hitherto stopped thoughtfully enough to count the human cost, the cost of lives snuffed out, of energies overtaxed and broken, the fearful physical and spiritual cost to the men and women and children upon whom the dead weight and burden of it all has fallen pitilessly the years through sep the groans and agony of it all had not yet reached our ears, the solemn, moving undertone of our life, coming up out of the mines and factories, and out of every home where the struggle had its intimate and familiar seat sep with the great government went many deep secret things which we too long delayed to look into and scrutinize with candid, fearless eyes sep the great government we loved has too often been made use of for private and selfish purposes, and those who used it had forgotten the people sep at last a vision has been vouchsafed us of our life as a whole sep we see the bad with the good, the debased and decadent with the sound and vital sep with this vision we approach new affairs sep our duty is to cleanse, to reconsider, to restore, to correct the evil without impairing the good, to purify and humanize every process of our common life without weakening or sentimentalizing it sep there has been something crude and heartless and unfeeling in our haste to succeed and be great sep our thought has been "let every man look out for himself, let every generation look out for itself," while we reared giant machinery which made it impossible that any but those who stood at the levers of control should have a chance to look out for themselves sep we had not forgotten our morals sep we remembered well enough that we had set up a policy which was meant to serve the humblest as well as the most powerful, with an eye single to the standards of justice and fair play, and remembered it with pride sep but we were very heedless and in a hurry to be great sep 5 we have come now to the sober second thought sep the scales of heedlessness have fallen from our eyes sep we have made up our minds to square every process of our national life again with the standards we so proudly set up at the beginning and have always carried at our hearts sep our work is a work of restoration sep we have itemized with some degree of particularity the things that ought to be altered and here are some of the chief items: a tariff which cuts us off from our proper part in the commerce of the world, violates the just principles of taxation, and makes the government a facile instrument in the hand of private interests; a banking and currency system based upon the necessity of the government to sell its bonds fifty years ago and perfectly adapted to concentrating cash and restricting credits; an industrial system which, take it on all its sides, financial as well as administrative, holds capital in leading strings, restricts the liberties and limits the opportunities of labor, and exploits without renewing or conserving the natural resources of the country; a body of agricultural activities never yet given the efficiency of great business undertakings or served as it should be through the instrumentality of science taken directly to the farm, or afforded the facilities of credit best suited to its practical needs; watercourses undeveloped, waste places unreclaimed, forests untended, fast disappearing without plan or prospect of renewal, un-regarded waste heaps at every mine sep we have studied as perhaps no other nation has the most effective means of production, but we have not studied cost or economy as we should either as organizers of industry, as statesmen, or as individuals sep nor have we studied and perfected the means by which government may be put at the service of humanity, in safeguarding the health of the nation, the health of its men and its women and its children, as well as their rights in the struggle for existence sep this is no sentimental duty sep the firm basis of government is justice, not pity sep these are matters of justice sep there can be no equality or opportunity, the first essential of justice in the body politic, if men and women and children be not shielded in their lives, their very vitality, from the consequences of great industrial and social processes which they can not alter, control, or singly cope with sep society must see to it that it does not itself crush or weaken or damage its own constituent parts sep the first duty of law is to keep sound the society it serves sep sanitary laws, pure food laws, and laws determining conditions of labor which individuals are powerless to determine for themselves are intimate parts of the very business of justice and legal efficiency sep these are some of the things we ought to do, and not leave the others undone, the old-fashioned, never-to-be-neglected, fundamental safeguarding of property and of individual right sep this is the high enterprise of the new day: to lift everything that concerns our life as a nation to the light that shines from the hearthfire of every man's conscience and vision of the right sep it is inconceivable that we should do this as partisans; it is inconceivable we should do it in ignorance of the facts as they are or in blind haste sep we shall restore, not destroy sep we shall deal with our economic system as it is and as it may be modified, not as it might be if we had a clean sheet of paper to write upon; and step by step we shall make it what it should be, in the spirit of those who question their own wisdom and seek counsel and knowledge, not shallow self-satisfaction or the excitement of excursions whither they can not tell sep justice, and only justice, shall always be our motto sep and yet it will be no cool process of mere science sep the nation has been deeply stirred, stirred by a solemn passion, stirred by the knowledge of wrong, of ideals lost, of government too often debauched and made an instrument of evil sep the feelings with which we face this new age of right and opportunity sweep across our heartstrings like some air out of god's own presence, where justice and mercy are reconciled and the judge and the brother are one sep we know our task to be no mere task of politics but a task which shall search us through and through, whether we be able to understand our time and the need of our people, whether we be indeed their spokesmen and interpreters, whether we have the pure heart to comprehend and the rectified will to choose our high course of action sep this is not a day of triumph;

and for pouring milk in the river, and for destroying and burying hogs and cattle by the millions, all while people starve and go naked -- do you think those plans were the original ideas of this roosevelt administration sep if you do, you are wrong sep the whole idea of that kind of thing first came from hoover's administration sep don't you remember when mr sep hoover proposed to plow up every fourth row of cotton sep we laughed him into scorn sep president roosevelt flayed him for proposing such a thing in the speech which he made from the steps of the capitol in topeka, kans sep and so we beat mr sep hoover on his plan sep but when mr sep roosevelt started on his plan, it was not to plow up every fourth row of cotton as hoover tried to do sep roosevelt's plan was to plow up every third row of cotton, just one-twelfth more cotton to be plowed up than hoover proposed sep roosevelt succeeded in his plan sep so it has been that while millions have starved and gone naked; so it has been that while babies have cried and died for milk; so it has been that while people have begged for meat and bread, mr sep roosevelt's administration has sailed merrily along, plowing under and destroying the things to eat and to wear, with tear-dimmed eyes and hungry souls made to chant for this new deal so that even their starvation dole is not taken away, and meanwhile the food and clothes craved by their bodies and souls go for destruction and ruin sep what is it sep is it government sep maybe so sep it looks more like st sep vitus dance sep now, since they sallied forth with general johnson to start the war on me, let us take a look at this nra that they opened up around here two years ago sep they had parades and fascist signs just as hitler, and mussolini sep they started the dictatorship here to regiment business and labor much more than anyone did in germany or italy sep the only difference was in the sign sep italy's sign of the fascist was a black shirt sep germany's sign of the fascist was a swastika sep so in america they sidetracked the stars and stripes, and the sign of the blue eagle was used instead sep and they proceeded with the nra sep everything from a peanut stand to a power house had to have a separate book of rules and laws to regulate what they did sep if a peanut stand started to parch a sack of goobers for sale, they had to be careful to go through the rule book sep one slip and he went to jail sep a little fellow w ho pressed a pair of pants went to jail because he charged 5 cents under the price set in the rule book sep so they wrote their nra rule book, codes, laws, etc sep they got up over 900 of them sep one would be as thick as an unabridged dictionary and as confusing as a study of the stars sep it would take 40 lawyers to tell a shoe-shine stand how to operate and be certain he didn't go to jail sep some people came to me for advice, as a lawyer, on how to run business sep i took several days and then couldn't understand it myself sep the only thing i could tell them was that it couldn't be much worse in jail than it was out of jail with that kind of thing going on in the country, and so to go on and do the best they could sep the whole thing of mr sep roosevelt, as run under general johnson, became such a national scandal that roosevelt had to let johnson slide out as the scapegoat sep let them call for an nra parade tomorrow and you couldn't get enough people to form a funeral march sep it was under this nra and the other funny alphabetical combinations which followed it that we ran the whole country into a mares nest sep the farleys and johnsons combed the land with agents, inspectors, supervisors, detectives, secretaries, assistants, etc sep , all armed with the power to arrest and send to jail whomever they found not living up to some rule in one of these 900 catalogs sep one man whose case reached the supreme court of the united states was turned loose because they couldn't even find the rule he was supposed to have violated in a search throughout the united states sep and now it is with pwa's, cwa's, nra's, aaa's, j-ug's, g-in's, and every other flimsy combination that the country finds its affairs and business tangled to where no one can recognize it sep more men are now out of work than ever; the debt of the united states has gone up another $10 billion sep there is starvation; there is homelessness; there is misery on every hand and corner, but mind you, in the meantime, mr sep roosevelt has had his way sep he is one man that can't blame any of his troubles on huey long sep he has had his way sep down in my part of the country if any man has the measles he blames that on me; but there is one man that can't blame anything on anybody but himself, and that is mr sep franklin de-la-no roosevelt sep and now, on top of that, they order war on me because nearly 4 years ago i told hoover's crowd it wouldn't do and because 3 years ago i told roosevelt and his crowd it wouldn't do sep in other words, they are in a rage at huey long because i have said, "i told you so sep "i am not overstating the conditions now prevailing in this country sep in their own words they have confessed all i now say or ever have said sep mr sep roosevelt and even mrs sep roosevelt have bewailed the fact that food, clothes, and shelter have not been provided for the people sep even gen sep hugh s sep johnson said in his speech of monday night that there are 80 million people in america who are badly hurt or wrecked by this depression sep mr sep harry hopkins, who runs the relief work, says the dole roll has risen now to 22,375,000 persons, the highest it has ever been sep and now, what is there for the roosevelt crowd to do but to admit the facts and admit further that they are now on their third year, making matters worse instead of better all the time sep no one is to blame, except them, for what is going on because they have had their way sep and if they couldn't change the thing in over two years, now bogged down worse than ever, how could anyone expect any good of them hereafter sep god save us two more years of the disaster we have had under that gang sep now, my friends, when this condition of distress and suffering among so many millions of our people began to develop in the hoover administration, we knew then what the trouble was and what we would have to do to correct it sep i was the first man to say publicly -- but mr sep roosevelt followed in my tracks a few months later and said the same thing sep we said that all of our trouble and woe was due to the fact that too few of our people owned too much of our wealth sep we said that in our land, with too much to eat, and too much to wear, and too many houses to live in, too many automobiles to be sold, that the only trouble was that the people suffered in the land of abundance because too few controlled the money and the wealth and too many did not have money with which to buy the things they needed for life and comfort sep so i said to the people of the united states in my speeches which i delivered in the united states senate in the early part of 1932 that the only way by which we could restore our people to reasonable life and comfort was to limit the size of the big man's fortune and guarantee some minimum to the fortune and comfort of the little man's family sep i said then, as i have said since, that it was inhuman to have food rotting, cotton and wool going to waste, houses empty, and at the same time to have millions of our people starving, naked, and homeless because they could not buy the things which other men had and for which they had no use whatever sep so we convinced mr sep franklin delano roosevelt that it was necessary that he announce and promise to the american people that in the event he were elected president of the united states he would pull down the size of the big man's fortune and guarantee something to every family -- enough to do away with all poverty and to give employment to those who were able to work and education to the children born into the world sep mr sep roosevelt made those promises; he made them before he was nominated in the chicago convention sep he made them again before he was elected in november, and he went so far as to remake those promises after he was inaugurated president of the united states sep and i thought for a day or two after he took the oath as president, that maybe he was going through with his promises sep no heart was ever so saddened; no person's ambition was ever so blighted, as was mine when i came to the realization that the president of the united states was not going to undertake what he had said he would do, and what i know to be necessary if the people of america were ever saved from calamity and misery sep so now, my friends, i come to that point where i must in a few sentences describe to you just what was the cause of our trouble which became so serious in 1929, and which has been worse ever since sep the wealth in the united states was three times as much in 1910 as it was in 1890, and yet the masses of our people owned less in 1910 than they did in 1890 sep in the year 1916 the condition had become so bad that a committee provided for by the congress of the united states reported that 2 percent of the people in the united states owned 60 percent of the wealth in the country, and that 65 percent of the people owned less than 5 percent of the wealth sep this report showed, however, that there was a middle class -- some 33 percent of the people -- who owned 35 percent of the wealth sep this report went on to say that the trouble with the american people at that time was that too much of the wealth was in the hands of too few of the people, and recommended that something be done to correct the evil condition then existing sep it was at about the same time that many of our publications began to deplore the fact that so few people owned so much and that so many people owned so little sep among those commenting upon that situation was the saturday evening post, which, in an issue of september 23, 1916, said: along one statistical line you can figure out a nation bustling with wealth; along another a bloated plutocracy comprising 1 percent of the population lording it over a starving horde with only a thin margin of merely well-to-do in between sep and it was, as the saturday evening post and the committee appointed by congress said, it was a deplorable thing back in 1916, when it was found that 2 percent of the people owned twice as much as all of the remainder of the people put together, and that 65 percent of all of our people owned practically nothing sep but what did we do to correct that condition sep instead of moving to take these big fortunes from the top and spreading them among the suffering people at the bottom, the financial masters of america moved in to take complete charge of the government for fear our lawmakers might do something along that line sep and as a result, 14 years after the report of 1916, the federal trade commission made a study to see how the wealth of this land was distributed, and did they find it still as bad as it was in 1916 sep they found it worse sep they found that 1 percent of the people owned about 59 percent of the wealth, which was almost twice as bad as what was said to be an intolerable condition in 1916, when 2 percent of the people owned 60 percent of the wealth sep and as a result of foreclosures, failures, and bankruptcies, which began to happen prior to and in the year of 1929, before the campaign of 1932, and at this late date, it is the estimate of all conservative statisticians that 75 percent of the people in the united states don't own anything, that is, not enough to pay their debts, and that 4 percent of the people, or maybe less than 4 percent of the people, own from 85 to 90 percent of all our wealth in the united states sep remember, in 1916 there was a middle class -- 33 percent of the people -- who owned 35 percent of the wealth sep that middle class is practically gone today sep it no longer exists sep they have dropped into the ranks of the poor sep the thriving man of independent business standing is fast fading sep the corner grocery store is becoming a thing of the past sep concentrated chain-merchandise and banking systems have laid waste to all middle opportunity sep that "thin margin of merely well-to-do in between" which the saturday evening post mentioned on september 23, 1916, has dwindled to practically no margin of well-to-do in between sep those suffering on the bottom and the few lords of finance on the top are nearly all that are left sep it became apparent that the billionaires and multimillionaires even began to squeeze out the common millionaires, closing in and taking their properties and wrecking their businesses sep and so we arrived (and are still there) at the place that in abundant america where we have everything for which a human heart can pray, the hundreds of millions -- or, as general johnson says, the 80 million -- of our people are crying in misery for the want of the things which they need for life, notwithstanding the fact that the country has had and can have more than the entire human race can consume sep the 125 million people of america have seated themselves at the barbecue table to consume the products which have been guaranteed to them by their lord and creator sep there is provided by the almighty what it takes for them all to eat; yea, more sep there is provided more than what is needed for all to eat sep but the financial masters of america have taken off the barbecue table 90 percent of the food placed thereon by god, through the labors of mankind, even before the feast begins, and there is left on that table to be eaten by 125 million people less than should be there for 10 million of them sep what has become of the remainder of those things placed on the table by the lord for the use of us all sep they are in the hands of the morgans, the rockefellers, the mellons, the baruches, the bakers, the astors, and the vanderbilts -- 600 families at the most either possessing or controlling the entire 90 percent of all that is in america sep they cannot eat the food, they cannot wear the clothes, so they destroy it sep they have it rotted; they plow it up; they pour it into the rivers; they bring destruction through the acts of mankind to let humanity suffer; to let humanity go naked; to let humanity go homeless, so that nothing may occur that will do harm to their vanity and to their greed sep like the dog in the manger, they command a wagon load of hay, which the dog would not allow the cow to eat, though he could not eat it himself sep so now, ladies and gentlemen, we come to that plan of mine for which i have been so roundly denounced and condemned by such men as mr sep farley, mr sep robinson, and gen sep hugh s sep johnson, and other spellers and speakers and spoilers of the roosevelt administration sep it is for the redistribution of wealth and for guaranteeing comforts and conveniences to all humanity out of this abundance in our country sep i hope none will be horror-stricken when they hear me say that we must limit the size of the big man's fortune in order to guarantee a minimum of fortune, life and comfort to the little man; but, if you are, think first that such is the declaration on which roosevelt rode into the nomination and election of president sep while my urgings are declared by some to be the average of a madman, and by such men as general johnson as insincere bait of a pied piper, if you will listen to me you will find that it is restating the laws handed down by god to man; you will find that it was the exact provision of the contract and law of the pilgrim fathers who landed at plymouth in 1620 sep here's what the pilgrim fathers said in the contract with the early settlers in the year 1620 sep i read you article 5 from that contract: 5: that at ye end of ye 7 sep years, ye capital & profits, viz sep the houses, lands, goods, and chattels, be equally divided betwixt ye adventurers, and planters; which done, every man shall be free from other of them of any debt or detriment concerning this adventure sep so the pilgrim fathers wrote into the covenant to do just exactly what the bible said to do, that they should have an equal division of the wealth every seven years sep i don't go that far; i merely advocate that no man be allowed to become so big that he makes paupers out of a million other peopleyou will find that it is the cornerstone on which nearly every religion since the beginning of man has been founded sep you will find that it was urged by bacon, milton, and shakespeare in england, by socrates, plato, theognis, and other wisest of men in greece, by pope pius xi in the vatican, by the world's greatest inventor, marconi in italy, by daniel webster, ralph waldo emerson, abraham lincoln, andrew jackson, william jennings bryan, and theodore roosevelt in the united states, as well as by nearly all of the thousands of great men whose names are yet mentioned in history sep the principle was not only the mainspring of roosevelt's nomination and election, but in the closing speech of herbert hoover at madison square garden in november 1932, even hoover said: my conception of america is a land where men and women may walk in ordered liberty, where they may enjoy the advantages of wealth, not concentrated in the hands of a few but diffused through the lives of all sep and so now i come to give you again that plan, taken from these leaders of all times and from the bible, for the sponsoring of which i am labeled america's menace, madman, pied piper, and demagogue sep i propose: first: that every big fortune shall be cut down immediately by a capital levy tax to where no one will own more than a few million dollars, as a matter of fact, to where no one can very long own a fortune in excess of about three to four millions of dollars sep i propose that the surplus of all the big fortunes, above the few millions to any one person at the most, shall go into the united states ownership sep how would we get all these surplus fortunes into the united states treasury sep not hard to do sep we would not do it by making everyone sell what he owned; no sep we would send everyone a questionnaire sep on that he would list the properties he owns, lands and houses, stocks and bonds, factories and patents, and so on sep every man would place his appraisal on his property, which the government would review and maybe change on some items sep on that appraisal the big fortune holder would say out of what property he would retain the few millions allowed to him, the balance to go to the united states sep say mr sep henry ford should allow that he owned all the stock of the ford motor co sep , worth, say, $2 billion; he could claim, say $4 million of the ford stock, but $1,996,000,000 would go to the united states sep say the rockefeller fortune was listed at $10 billion in oil stocks, bank stocks, money, and stores sep each rockefeller could say whether he wanted his limit in either the money, oil, or bank stocks, but about nine billion and eight hundred million would go to the government sep and so, in this way, the government of the united states would come into the possession of about two-fifths of its wealth, which on normal values would be worth, say, $165 billion sep then we would turn to the inventories of the 25 million families of america sep all those who showed properties and money clear of debts that were above $5,000 and up to the limit of a few millions would not be touched sep but those showing less than $5,000 to the family free of debt would be added to, so that every family would start life again with homestead possessions of at least a home and the comforts needed for a home, including such things as a radio and an automobile sep these things would go to every family as a homestead, not to be sold either for debts or taxes or even by consent of the owner except by the consent of the court or government, and then only on condition that the court hold it to be spent for the purpose of buying another home and comforts thereof sep such would mean that the $165 billion or more taken from big fortunes would have about $100 billion of it used to provide all with the comforts of home and living sep the government might have to issue warrants for claim and location, or even currency to be retired from such property as was claimed, but all that is a detail not impractical to get these homes into the hands of the people sep so america would start again with millionaires, but no multi-millionaires or billionaires; with some poor, but none too poor to be denied the comforts of life sep america, however, would still have maybe a $65 billion balance from these big fortunes not yet used to set up the poor people sep what would we do with that sep wait a moment sep i am coming to that, too sep second: we propose that after homes and comforts of homes have been set up for the families of the country, that we shall turn our attention to the children and the youth of the land, providing first for their education and training sep we would not have to worry about the problem of child labor, because the very first thing which we would place in front of every child would be not only a comfortable home during his early years but the opportunity for education and training, not only through the grammar school and the high school but through college and to include vocational and professional training for every child sep if necessary, that would include the living cost of that child while he attended college, if one should be too distant for him to live at home and conveniently attend, as would be the case with many of those living in the rural areas sep we now have an educational system, and in states like louisiana -- and it is the best one -- where school books are furnished free to every child and where transportation by bus is given to every student, however far he may live from a grammar or high school; there is a fairly good assurance of education through grammar and high school for the child whose father and mother have enough at home to feed and clothe them sep but when it comes to a matter of college education, except in few cases the right to a college education is determined at this day and time by the financial ability of the father and mother to pay for the cost and the expense of a college education sep it don't make any difference how brilliant a boy or girl may be, that don't give them the right to a college education in america today sep now, gen sep hugh johnson says i am indeed a very smart demagogue, a wise and dangerous menace sep but i am one of those who didn't have the opportunity to secure a college education or training sep we propose that the right to education and the extent of education shall be determined and gauged not so much by the financial ability of the parents but by the mental ability and energy of a child to absorb the learning at a college sep this should appeal to general johnson, who says i am a smart man, since, had i enjoyed the learning and college training which my plan would provide for others, i might not have fallen into the path of the dangerous menace and demagogue that he has now found me to be sep remember, we have $65 billion to account for that would lie in the hands of the united states, even after providing home comforts for all families sep we will use a large part of it immediately to expand particularly the colleges and universities of this country sep you would not know the great institutions like yale, harvard, and louisiana state university sep get ready for a surprise sep college enrollments would multiply 1,000 percent sep we would immediately call in the architects and engineers, the idle professors and scholars of learning sep we would send out a hurry call because the problem of providing college education for all of the youth would start a fusillade of employment which might suddenly and immediately make it possible for us to shorten the hours of labor, even as we contemplate in the balance of our program sep and how happy the youth of this land would be tomorrow morning if they knew instantly their right to a home and the comforts of a home and to complete college and professional training and education were assured sep i know how happy they would be, because i know how i would have felt had such a message been delivered to my door sep i cannot deliver that promise to the youth of this land tonight, but i am doing my part sep i am standing the blows; i am hearing the charges hurled at me from the four quarters of the country sep it is the same fight which was made against me in louisiana when i was undertaking to provide the free school books, free busses, university facilities, and things of that kind to educate the youth of that state as best i could sep it is the same blare which i heard when i was undertaking to provide for the sick and the afflicted sep when the youth of this land realizes what is meant and what is contemplated the billingsgate and the profanity of all the farleys and johnsons in america can't prevent the light of truth from hurling itself in understandable letters against the dark canopy of the sky sep now, when we have landed at the place where homes and comforts are provided for all families and complete education and training for all young men and women, the next problem is what about our income to sustain our people thereafter sep how shall that be arranged to guarantee all the fair share of what soul and body need to sustain them conveniently sep that brings us to our next point sep we propose: number 3: we shall shorten the hours of labor by law so much as may be necessary that none will be worked too long and none unemployed sep we shall cut the hours of toil to 30 hours per week, maybe less; we may cut the working year to 11 months' work and 1 month's vacation; maybe less sep if our great improvement programs show we need more labor than we may have, we will lengthen the hours as convenience requires sep at all events, the hours for production will be gauged to meet the market for consumption sep we will need all our machinery for many years, because we have much public improvement to do; and, further, the more use that we may make of them, the less toil will be required for all of us to survive in splendor sep now, a minimum earning would be established for any person with a family to support sep it would be such a living which one, already owning a home, could maintain a family in comfort, of not less than $2,500 per year to every family sep and now by reason of false statements made, particularly by mr sep arthur brisbane and gen sep hugh s sep johnson, i must make answer to show you that there is more than enough in this country and more than enough raised and made every year to do what i propose sep mr sep brisbane says i am proposing to give every person $15,000 for a home and its comforts, and he says that would mean the united states would have to be worth over a trillion dollars sep why make that untrue statement, mr sep brisbane sep you know that is not so sep i do not propose any home and comfort of $15,000 to each person -- it is a minimum of $5,000 to every family, which would be less than $125 billion, which is less than one-third of this nation's wealth in normal times of $400 billion sep general johnson says that my proposal is for $5,000 guaranteed earning to each family, which he says would cost from four to five hundred millions of dollars per year, which he says is four times more than our whole national income ever has been sep why make such untrue statements, general johnson sep must you be a false witness to argue your point sep i do not propose $5,000 income per year to each family sep i propose a minimum of from $2,000 to $2,500 income per year to each family sep for 25 million families that minimum income per family would require from $50 billion to $60 sep 6 billion sep in the prosperous days we have had nearly double that for income some years already, which allowed plenty for the affluent; but with the unheard prosperity we would have, if all our people could buy what they need, our national income would be double what it has ever been sep the wall street writer and statistician says we could have an income of at least $10,000 to every family in goods if all worked short hours and none were idle sep according to him, only one-fourth of the average income would carry out my plan sep and now i come to the remainder of the plan sep we propose: number 4: that agricultural production will be cared for in the manner specified in the bible sep we would plow under no crops; we would burn no corn; we would spill no milk into the river; we would shoot no hogs; would slaughter no cattle to be rotted sep what we would do is this: we would raise all the cotton that we could raise, all the corn that we could raise, and everything else that we could raise sep let us say, for example, that we raised more cotton than we could use sep but here again i wish to surprise you when i say that if everyone could buy all the towels, all the sheets, all the bedding, all the clothing, all the carpets, all the window curtains, and all of everything else he reasonably needs; america would consume 20 million bales
ESFJ	mr sep chief justice, my dear friends, my fellow americans: the oath that i have taken is the same oath that was taken by george washington and by every president under the constitution sep but i assume the presidency under extraordinary circumstances never before experienced by americans sep this is an hour of history that troubles our minds and hurts our hearts sep therefore, i feel it is my first duty to make an unprecedented compact with my countrymen sep not an inaugural address, not a fireside chat, not a campaign speech -- just a little straight talk among friends sep and i intend it to be the first of many sep i am acutely aware that you have not elected me as your president by your ballots, and so i ask you to confirm me as your president with your prayers sep and i hope that such prayers will also be the first of many sep if you have not chosen me by secret ballot, neither have i gained office by any secret promises sep i have not campaigned either for the presidency or the vice presidency sep i have not subscribed to any partisan platform sep i am indebted to no man, and only to one woman -- my dear wife -- as i begin this very difficult job sep i have not sought this enormous responsibility, but i will not shirk it sep those who nominated and confirmed me as vice president were my friends and are my friends sep they were of both parties, elected by all the people and acting under the constitution in their name sep it is only fitting then that i should pledge to them and to you that i will be the president of all the people sep thomas jefferson said the people are the only sure reliance for the preservation of our liberty sep and down the years, abraham lincoln renewed this american article of faith asking, "is there any better way or equal hope in the world sep "i intend, on monday next, to request of the speaker of the house of representatives and the president pro tempore of the senate the privilege of appearing before the congress to share with my former colleagues and with you, the american people, my views on the priority business of the nation and to solicit your views and their views sep and may i say to the speaker and the others, if i could meet with you right after these remarks, i would appreciate it sep even though this is late in an election year, there is no way we can go forward except together and no way anybody can win except by serving the people's urgent needs sep we cannot stand still or slip backwards sep we must go forward now together sep to the peoples and the governments of all friendly nations, and i hope that could encompass the whole world, i pledge an uninterrupted and sincere search for peace sep america will remain strong and united, but its strength will remain dedicated to the safety and sanity of the entire family of man, as well as to our own precious freedom sep i believe that truth is the glue that holds government together, not only our government but civilization itself sep that bond, though stained, is unbroken at home and abroad sep in all my public and private acts as your president, i expect to follow my instincts of openness and candor with full confidence that honesty is always the best policy in the end sep my fellow americans, our long national nightmare is over sep our constitution works sep our great republic is a government of laws and not of men sep here, the people rule sep but there is a higher power, by whatever name we honor him, who ordains not only righteousness but love, not only justice but mercy sep as we bind up the internal wounds of watergate, more painful and more poisonous than those of foreign wars, let us restore the golden rule to our political process, and let brotherly love purge our hearts of suspicion and of hate sep in the beginning, i asked you to pray for me sep before closing, i ask again your prayers, for richard nixon and for his family sep may our former president, who brought peace to millions, find it for himself sep may god bless and comfort his wonderful wife and daughters, whose love and loyalty will forever be a shining legacy to all who bear the lonely burdens of the white house sep i can only guess at those burdens, although i have witnessed at close hand the tragedies that befell three presidents and the lesser trials of others sep with all the strength and all the good sense i have gained from life, with all the confidence of my family, my friends, and my dedicated staff impart to me, and with the good will of countless americans i have encountered in recent visits to 40 states, i now solemnly reaffirm my promise i made to you last december 6: to uphold the constitution; to do what is right as god gives me to see the right; and to do the very best i can for america sep god helping me, i will not let you down sep thank you
ISFJ	good evening: this a special night for me sep exactly three years ago, on july 15, 1976, i accepted the nomination of my party to run for president of the united states sep i promised you a president who is not isolated from the people, who feels your pain, and who shares your dreams, and who draws his strength and his wisdom from you sep during the past three years ive spoken to you on many occasions about national concerns, the energy crisis, reorganizing the government, our nations economy, and issues of war and especially peace sep but over those years the subjects of the speeches, the talks, and the press conferences have become increasingly narrow, focused more and more on what the isolated world of washington thinks is important sep gradually, youve heard more and more about what the government thinks or what the government should be doing and less and less about our nations hopes, our dreams, and our vision of the future sep ten days ago, i had planned to speak to you again about a very important subject -- energy sep for the fifth time i would have described the urgency of the problem and laid out a series of legislative recommendations to the congress sep but as i was preparing to speak, i began to ask myself the same question that i now know has been troubling many of you: why have we not been able to get together as a nation to resolve our serious energy problem sep its clear that the true problems of our nation are much deeper -- deeper than gasoline lines or energy shortages, deeper even than inflation or recession sep and i realize more than ever that as president i need your help sep so, i decided to reach out and to listen to the voices of america sep i invited to camp david people from almost every segment of our society -- business and labor, teachers and preachers, governors, mayors, and private citizens sep and then i left camp david to listen to other americans, men and women like you sep it has been an extraordinary ten days, and i want to share with you what ive heard sep first of all, i got a lot of personal advice sep let me quote a few of the typical comments that i wrote down sep this from a southern governor: mr sep president, you are not leading this nation -- youre just managing the government sep you dont see the people enough anymore sep some of your cabinet members dont seem loyal sep there is not enough discipline among your disciples sep dont talk to us about politics or the mechanics of government, but about an understanding of our common good sep mr sep president, were in trouble sep talk to us about blood and sweat and tears sep if you lead, mr sep president, we will follow sep many people talked about themselves and about the condition of our nation sep this from a young woman in pennsylvania: i feel so far from government sep i feel like ordinary people are excluded from political power sep and this from a young chicano: some of us have suffered from recession all our lives sep some people have wasted energy, but others havent had anything to waste sep and this from a religious leader: no material shortage can touch the important things like gods love for us or our love for one another sep and i like this one particularly from a black woman who happens to be the mayor of a small mississippi town: the big shots are not the only ones who are important sep remember, you cant sell anything on wall street unless someone digs it up somewhere else first sep this kind of summarized a lot of other statements: mr sep president, we are confronted with a moral and a spiritual crisis sep several of our discussions were on energy, and i have a notebook full of comments and advice sep ill read just a few sep we cant go on consuming forty percent more energy then we produce sep when we import oil we are also importing inflation plus unemployment sep weve got to use what we have sep the middle east has only five percent of the worlds energy, but the united states has twenty-four percent sep and this is one of the most vivid statements: our neck is stretched over the fence and opec has a knife sep there will be other cartels and other shortages sep american wisdom and courage right now can set a path to follow in the future sep this was a good one: be bold, mr sep president sep we may make mistakes, but we are ready to experiment sep and this one from a labor leader got to the heart of it: the real issue is freedom sep we must deal with the energy problem on a war footing sep and the last that ill read: when we enter the moral equivalent of war, mr sep president, dont issue us bb guns sep these ten days confirmed my belief in the decency and the strength and the wisdom of the american people, but it also bore out some of my longstanding concerns about our nations underlying problems sep i know, of course, being president, that government actions and legislation can be very important sep thats why ive worked hard to put my campaign promises into law, and i have to admit, with just mixed success sep but after listening to the american people, i have been reminded again that all the legislation in the world cant fix whats wrong with america sep so, i want to speak to you first tonight about a subject even more serious than energy or inflation sep i want to talk to you right now about a fundamental threat to american democracy sep i do not mean our political and civil liberties sep they will endure sep and i do not refer to the outward strength of america, a nation that is at peace tonight everywhere in the world, with unmatched economic power and military might sep the threat is nearly invisible in ordinary ways sep it is a crisis of confidence sep it is a crisis that strikes at the very heart and soul and spirit of our national will sep we can see this crisis in the growing doubt about the meaning of our own lives and in the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation sep the erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of america sep the confidence that we have always had as a people is not simply some romantic dream or a proverb in a dusty book that we read just on the fourth of july sep it is the idea which founded our nation and has guided our development as a people sep confidence in the future has supported everything else -- public institutions and private enterprise, our own families, and the very constitution of the united states sep confidence has defined our course and has served as a link between generations sep weve always believed in something called progress sep weve always had a faith that the days of our children would be better than our own sep our people are losing that faith, not only in government itself but in the ability as citizens to serve as the ultimate rulers and shapers of our democracy sep as a people we know our past and we are proud of it sep our progress has been part of the living history of america, even the world sep we always believed that we were part of a great movement of humanity itself called democracy, involved in the search for freedom; and that belief has always strengthened us in our purpose sep but just as we are losing our confidence in the future, we are also beginning to close the door on our past sep in a nation that was proud of hard work, strong families, close-knit communities, and our faith in god, too many of us now tend to worship self-indulgence and consumption sep human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns sep but weve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning sep weve learned that piling up material goods cannot fill the emptiness of lives which have no confidence or purpose sep the symptoms of this crisis of the american spirit are all around us sep for the first time in the history of our country a majority of our people believe that the next five years will be worse than the past five years sep two-thirds of our people do not even vote sep the productivity of american workers is actually dropping, and the willingness of americans to save for the future has fallen below that of all other people in the western world sep as you know, there is a growing disrespect for government and for churches and for schools, the news media, and other institutions sep this is not a message of happiness or reassurance, but it is the truth and it is a warning sep these changes did not happen overnight sep theyve come upon us gradually over the last generation, years that were filled with shocks and tragedy sep we were sure that ours was a nation of the ballot, not the bullet, until the murders of john kennedy and robert kennedy and martin luther king, jr sep we were taught that our armies were always invincible and our causes were always just, only to suffer the agony of vietnam sep we respected the presidency as a place of honor until the shock of watergate sep we remember when the phrase sound as a dollar was an expression of absolute dependability, until ten years of inflation began to shrink our dollar and our savings sep we believed that our nations resources were limitless until 1973 when we had to face a growing dependence on foreign oil sep these wounds are still very deep sep they have never been healed sep looking for a way out of this crisis, our people have turned to the federal government and found it isolated from the mainstream of our nations life sep washington, d sep c sep , has become an island sep the gap between our citizens and our government has never been so wide sep the people are looking for honest answers, not easy answers; clear leadership, not false claims and evasiveness and politics as usual sep what you see too often in washington and elsewhere around the country is a system of government that seems incapable of action sep you see a congress twisted and pulled in every direction by hundreds of well-financed and powerful special interests sep you see every extreme position defended to the last vote, almost to the last breath by one unyielding group or another sep you often see a balanced and a fair approach that demands sacrifice, a little sacrifice from everyone, abandoned like an orphan without support and without friends sep often you see paralysis and stagnation and drift sep you dont like it, and neither do i sep what can we do sep first of all, we must face the truth, and then we can change our course sep we simply must have faith in each other, faith in our ability to govern ourselves, and faith in the future of this nation sep restoring that faith and that confidence to america is now the most important task we face sep it is a true challenge of this generation of americans sep one of the visitors to camp david last week put it this way: weve got to stop crying and start sweating, stop talking and start walking, stop cursing and start praying sep the strength we need will not come from the white house, but from every house in america sep we know the strength of america sep we are strong sep we can regain our unity sep we can regain our confidence sep we are the heirs of generations who survived threats much more powerful and awesome than those that challenge us now sep our fathers and mothers were strong men and women who shaped a new society during the great depression, who fought world wars and who carved out a new charter of peace for the world sep we ourselves are the same americans who just ten years ago put a man on the moon sep we are the generation that dedicated our society to the pursuit of human rights and equality sep and we are the generation that will win the war on the energy problem and in that process, rebuild the unity and confidence of america sep we are at a turning point in our history sep there are two paths to choose sep one is a path ive warned about tonight, the path that leads to fragmentation and self-interest sep down that road lies a mistaken idea of freedom, the right to grasp for ourselves some advantage over others sep that path would be one of constant conflict between narrow interests ending in chaos and immobility sep it is a certain route to failure sep all the traditions of our past, all the lessons of our heritage, all the promises of our future point to another path -- the path of common purpose and the restoration of american values sep that path leads to true freedom for our nation and ourselves sep we can take the first steps down that path as we begin to solve our energy problem sep energy will be the immediate test of our ability to unite this nation, and it can also be the standard around which we rally sep on the battlefield of energy we can win for our nation a new confidence, and we can seize control again of our common destiny sep in little more than two decades weve gone from a position of energy independence to one in which almost half the oil we use comes from foreign countries, at prices that are going through the roof sep our excessive dependence on opec has already taken a tremendous toll on our economy and our people sep this is the direct cause of the long lines which have made millions of you spend aggravating hours waiting for gasoline sep its a cause of the increased inflation and unemployment that we now face sep this intolerable dependence on foreign oil threatens our economic independence and the very security of our nation sep the energy crisis is real sep it is worldwide sep it is a clear and present danger to our nation sep these are facts and we simply must face them sep what i have to say to you now about energy is simple and vitally important sep point one: i am tonight setting a clear goal for the energy policy of the united states sep beginning this moment, this nation will never use more foreign oil than we
ESFP	thank you very much, governor keating and mrs sep keating, reverend graham, to the families of those who have been lost and wounded, to the people of oklahoma city, who have endured so much, and the people of this wonderful state, to all of you who are here as our fellow americans sep i am honored to be here today to represent the american people sep but i have to tell you that hillary and i also come as parents, as husband and wife, as people who were your neighbors for some of the best years of our lives sep today our nation joins with you in grief sep we mourn with you sep we share your hope against hope that some may still survive sep we thank all those who have worked so heroically to save lives and to solve this crime -- those here in oklahoma and those who are all across this great land, and many who left their own lives to come here to work hand in hand with you sep we pledge to do all we can to help you heal the injured, to rebuild this city, and to bring to justice those who did this evil sep this terrible sin took the lives of our american family, innocent children in that building, only because their parents were trying to be good parents as well as good workers; citizens in the building going about their daily business; and many there who served the rest of us -- who worked to help the elderly and the disabled, who worked to support our farmers and our veterans, who worked to enforce our laws and to protect us sep let us say clearly, they served us well, and we are grateful sep but for so many of you they were also neighbors and friends sep you saw them at church or the pta meetings, at the civic clubs, at the ball park sep you know them in ways that all the rest of america could not sep and to all the members of the families here present who have suffered loss, though we share your grief, your pain is unimaginable, and we know that sep we cannot undo it sep that is god's work sep our words seem small beside the loss you have endured sep but i found a few i wanted to share today sep i've received a lot of letters in these last terrible days sep one stood out because it came from a young widow and a mother of three whose own husband was murdered with over 200 other americans when pan am 103 was shot down sep here is what that woman said i should say to you today: the anger you feel is valid, but you must not allow yourselves to be consumed by it sep the hurt you feel must not be allowed to turn into hate, but instead into the search for justice sep the loss you feel must not paralyze your own lives sep instead, you must try to pay tribute to your loved ones by continuing to do all the things they left undone, thus ensuring they did not die in vain sep wise words from one who also knows sep you have lost too much, but you have not lost everything sep and you have certainly not lost america, for we will stand with you for as many tomorrows as it takes sep if ever we needed evidence of that, i could only recall the words of governor and mrs sep keating: if anybody thinks that americans are mostly mean and selfish, they ought to come to oklahoma sep if anybody thinks americans have lost the capacity for love and caring and courage, they ought to come to oklahoma sep to all my fellow americans beyond this hall, i say, one thing we owe those who have sacrificed is the duty to purge ourselves of the dark forces which gave rise to this evil sep they are forces that threaten our common peace, our freedom, our way of life sep let us teach our children that the god of comfort is also the god of righteousness: those who trouble their own house will inherit the wind sep 1 justice will prevail sep let us let our own children know that we will stand against the forces of fear sep when there is talk of hatred, let us stand up and talk against it sep when there is talk of violence, let us stand up and talk against it sep in the face of death, let us honor life sep as st sep paul admonished us, let us "not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good sep "2yesterday, hillary and i had the privilege of speaking with some children of other federal employees -- children like those who were lost here sep and one little girl said something we will never forget sep she said, "we should all plant a tree in memory of the children sep " so this morning before we got on the plane to come here, at the white house, we planted that tree in honor of the children of oklahoma sep it was a dogwood with its wonderful spring flower and its deep, enduring roots sep it embodies the lesson of the psalms -- that the life of a good person is like a tree whose leaf does not wither sep my fellow americans, a tree takes a long time to grow, and wounds take a long time to heal sep but we must begin sep those who are lost now belong to god sep some day we will be with them sep but until that happens, their legacy must be our lives sep thank you all, and god bless you
ESFP	thank you sep thank you, very much sep chancellor kohl, governing mayor diepgen, ladies and gentlemen: twenty four years ago, president john f sep kennedy visited berlin, and speaking to the people of this city and the world at the city hall sep well since then two other presidents have come, each in his turn to berlin sep and today, i, myself, make my second visit to your city sep we come to berlin, we american presidents, because it's our duty to speak in this place of freedom sep but i must confess, were drawn here by other things as well; by the feeling of history in this city -- more than 500 years older than our own nation; by the beauty of the grunewald and the tiergarten; most of all, by your courage and determination sep perhaps the composer, paul linke, understood something about american presidents sep you see, like so many presidents before me, i come here today because wherever i go, whatever i do: ich hab noch einen koffer in berlin sep [i still have a suitcase in berlin sep ]our gathering today is being broadcast throughout western europe and north america sep i understand that it is being seen and heard as well in the east sep to those listening throughout eastern europe, i extend my warmest greetings and the good will of the american people sep to those listening in east berlin, a special word: although i cannot be with you, i address my remarks to you just as surely as to those standing here before me sep for i join you, as i join your fellow countrymen in the west, in this firm, this unalterable belief: es gibt nur ein berlin sep [there is only one berlin sep ]behind me stands a wall that encircles the free sectors of this city, part of a vast system of barriers that divides the entire continent of europe sep from the baltic south, those barriers cut across germany in a gash of barbed wire, concrete, dog runs, and guard towers sep farther south, there may be no visible, no obvious wall sep but there remain armed guards and checkpoints all the same -- still a"restriction on the right to travel, still an instrument to impose upon ordinary men and women the will of a totalitarian state sep yet, it is here in berlin where the wall emerges most clearly; here, cutting across your city, where the news photo and the television screen have imprinted this brutal division of a continent upon the mind of the world sep standing before the brandenburg gate, every man is a german separated from his fellow men sep every man is a berliner, forced to look upon a scar sep president von weizs sep cker has said, "the german question is open as long as the brandenburg gate is closed sep " well today -- today i say: as long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the german question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind sep yet, i do not come here to lament sep for i find in berlin a message of hope, even in the shadow of this wall, a message of triumph sep in this season of spring in 1945, the people of berlin emerged from their air-raid shelters to find devastation sep thousands of miles away, the people of the united states reached out to help sep and in 1947 secretary of state -- as you've been told -- george marshall announced the creation of what would become known as the marshall plan sep speaking precisely 40 years ago this month, he said: "our policy is directed not against any country or doctrine, but against hunger, poverty, desperation, and chaos sep "in the reichstag a few moments ago, i saw a display commemorating this 40th anniversary of the marshall plan sep i was struck by a sign -- the sign on a burnt-out, gutted structure that was being rebuilt sep i understand that berliners of my own generation can remember seeing signs like it dotted throughout the western sectors of the city sep the sign read simply: "the marshall plan is helping here to strengthen the free world sep " a strong, free world in the west -- that dream became real sep japan rose from ruin to become an economic giant sep italy, france, belgium -- virtually every nation in western europe saw political and economic rebirth; the european community was founded sep in west germany and here in berlin, there took place an economic miracle, the wirtschaftswunder [miracle on the rhine] sep adenauer, erhard, reuter, and other leaders understood the practical importance of liberty -- that just as truth can flourish only when the journalist is given freedom of speech, so prosperity can come about only when the farmer and businessman enjoy economic freedom sep the german leaders -- the german leaders reduced tariffs, expanded free trade, lowered taxes sep from 1950 to 1960 alone, the standard of living in west germany and berlin doubled sep where four decades ago there was rubble, today in west berlin there is the greatest industrial output of any city in germany: busy office blocks, fine homes and apartments, proud avenues, and the spreading lawns of parkland sep where a city's culture seemed to have been destroyed, today there are two great universities, orchestras and an opera, countless theaters, and museums sep where there was want, today there's abundance -- food, clothing, automobiles -- the wonderful goods of the kudamm sep 1 from devastation, from utter ruin, you berliners have, in freedom, rebuilt a city that once again ranks as one of the greatest on earth sep now the soviets may have had other plans sep but my friends, there were a few things the soviets didn't count on: berliner herz, berliner humor, ja, und berliner schnauze sep [berliner heart, berliner humor, yes, and a berliner schnauze sep 2]in the 1950s -- in the 1950s khrushchev predicted: "we will bury you sep "but in the west today, we see a free world that has achieved a level of prosperity and well-being unprecedented in all human history sep in the communist world, we see failure, technological backwardness, declining standards of health, even want of the most basic kind -- too little food sep even today, the soviet union still cannot feed itself sep after these four decades, then, there stands before the entire world one great and inescapable conclusion: freedom leads to prosperity sep freedom replaces the ancient hatreds among nations with comity and peace sep freedom is the victor sep and now -- now the soviets themselves may, in a limited way, be coming to understand the importance of freedom sep we hear much from moscow about a new policy of reform and openness sep some political prisoners have been released sep certain foreign news broadcasts are no longer being jammed sep some economic enterprises have been permitted to operate with greater freedom from state control sep are these the beginnings of profound changes in the soviet state sep or are they token gestures intended to raise false hopes in the west, or to strengthen the soviet system without changing it sep we welcome change and openness; for we believe that freedom and security go together, that the advance of human liberty -- the advance of human liberty can only strengthen the cause of world peace sep there is one sign the soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace sep general secretary gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the soviet union and eastern europe, if you seek liberalization: come here to this gate sep mr sep gorbachev, open this gate sep mr sep gorbachev -- mr sep gorbachev, tear down this wall sep i understand the fear of war and the pain of division that afflict this continent, and i pledge to you my country's efforts to help overcome these burdens sep to be sure, we in the west must resist soviet expansion sep so, we must maintain defenses of unassailable strength sep yet we seek peace; so we must strive to reduce arms on both sides sep beginning 10 years ago, the soviets challenged the western alliance with a grave new threat, hundreds of new and more deadly ss-20 nuclear missiles capable of striking every capital in europe sep the western alliance responded by committing itself to a counter-deployment (unless the soviets agreed to negotiate a better solution) -- namely, the elimination of such weapons on both sides sep for many months, the soviets refused to bargain in earnestness sep as the alliance, in turn, prepared to go forward with its counter-deployment, there were difficult days, days of protests like those during my 1982 visit to this city; and the soviets later walked away from the table sep but through it all, the alliance held firm sep and i invite those who protested then -- i invite those who protest today -- to mark this fact: because we remained strong, the soviets came back to the table sep because we remained strong, today we have within reach the possibility, not merely of limiting the growth of arms, but of eliminating, for the first time, an entire class of nuclear weapons from the face of the earth sep as i speak, nato ministers are meeting in iceland to review the progress of our proposals for eliminating these weapons sep at the talks in geneva, we have also proposed deep cuts in strategic offensive weapons sep and the western allies have likewise made far-reaching proposals to reduce the danger of conventional war and to place a total ban on chemical weapons sep while we pursue these arms reductions, i pledge to you that we will maintain the capacity to deter soviet aggression at any level at which it might occur sep and in cooperation with many of our allies, the united states is pursuing the strategic defense initiative -- research to base deterrence not on the threat of offensive retaliation, but on defenses that truly defend; on systems, in short, that will not target populations, but shield them sep by these means we seek to increase the safety of europe and all the world sep but we must remember a crucial fact: east and west do not mistrust each other because we are armed; we are armed because we mistrust each other sep and our differences are not about weapons but about liberty sep when president kennedy spoke at the city hall those 24 years ago, freedom was encircled; berlin was under siege sep and today, despite all the pressures upon this city, berlin stands secure in its liberty sep and freedom itself is transforming the globe sep in the philippines, in south and central america, democracy has been given a rebirth sep throughout the pacific, free markets are working miracle after miracle of economic growth sep in the industrialized nations, a technological revolution is taking place, a revolution marked by rapid, dramatic advances in computers and telecommunications sep in europe, only one nation and those it controls refuse to join the community of freedom sep yet in this age of redoubled economic growth, of information and innovation, the soviet union faces a choice: it must make fundamental changes, or it will become obsolete sep today, thus, represents a moment of hope sep we in the west stand ready to cooperate with the east to promote true openness, to break down barriers that separate people, to create a safer, freer world sep and surely there is no better place than berlin, the meeting place of east and west, to make a start sep free people of berlin: today, as in the past, the united states stands for the strict observance and full implementation of all parts of the four power agreement of 1971 sep let us use this occasion, the 750th anniversary of this city, to usher in a new era, to seek a still fuller, richer life for the berlin of the future sep together, let us maintain and develop the ties between the federal republic and the western sectors of berlin, which is permitted by the 1971 agreement sep and i invite mr sep gorbachev: let us work to bring the eastern and western parts of the city closer together, so that all the inhabitants of all berlin can enjoy the benefits that come with life in one of the great cities of the world sep to open berlin still further to all europe, east and west, let us expand the vital air access to this city, finding ways of making commercial air service to berlin more convenient, more comfortable, and more economical sep we look to the day when west berlin can become one of the chief aviation hubs in all central europe sep with -- with our french -- with our french and british partners, the united states is prepared to help bring international meetings to berlin sep it would be only fitting for berlin to serve as the site of united nations meetings, or world conferences on human rights and arms control, or other issues that call for international cooperation sep there is no better way to establish hope for the future than to enlighten young minds, and we would be honored to sponsor summer youth exchanges, cultural events, and other programs for young berliners from the east sep our french and british friends, i'm certain, will do the same sep and it's my hope that an authority can be found in east berlin to sponsor visits from young people of the western sectors sep one final proposal, one close to my heart: sport represents a source of enjoyment and ennoblement, and you may have noted that the republic of korea -- south korea -- has offered to permit certain events of the 1988 olympics to take place in the north sep international sports competitions of all kinds could take place in both parts of this city sep and what better way to demonstrate to the world the openness of this city than to offer in some future year to hold the olympic games here in berlin, east and west sep in these four decades, as i have said, you berliners have built a great city sep you've done so in spite of threats -- the soviet attempts to impose the east-mark, the blockade sep today the city thrives in spite of the challenges implicit in the very presence of this wall sep what keeps you here sep certainly there's a great deal to be said for your fortitude, for your defiant courage sep but i believe there's something deeper, something that involves berlin's whole look and feel and way of life -- not mere sentiment sep no one could live long in berlin without being completely disabused of illusions sep something, instead, that has seen the difficulties of life in berlin but chose to accept them, that continues to build this good and proud city in contrast to a surrounding totalitarian presence, that refuses to release human energies or aspirations, something that speaks with a powerful voice of affirmation, that says "yes" to this city, yes to the future, yes to freedom sep in a word, i would submit that what keeps you in berlin -- is "love sep "love both profound and abiding sep perhaps this gets to the root of the matter, to the most fundamental distinction of all between east and west sep the totalitarian world produces backwardness because it does such violence to the spirit, thwarting the human impulse to create, to enjoy, to worship sep the totalitarian world finds even symbols of love and of worship an affront sep years ago, before the east germans began rebuilding their churches, they erected a secular structure: the television tower at alexander platz sep virtually ever since, the authorities have been working to correct what they view as the tower's one major flaw: treating the glass sphere at the top with paints and chemicals of every kind sep yet even today when the sun strikes that sphere, that sphere that towers over all berlin, the light makes the sign of the cross sep there in berlin, like the city itself, symbols of love, symbols of worship, cannot be suppressed sep as i looked out a moment ago from the reichstag, that embodiment of german unity, i noticed words crudely spray-painted upon the wall, perhaps by a young berliner (quote): "this wall will fall sep beliefs become reality sep "yes, across europe, this wall will fall, for it cann
INFJ	mr sep president, mrs sep clinton, members of congress, ambassador holbrooke, excellencies, friends: fifty-four years ago to the day, a young jewish boy from a small town in the carpathian mountains woke up, not far from goethe's beloved weimar, in a place of eternal infamy called buchenwald sep he was finally free, but there was no joy in his heart sep he thought there never would be again sep liberated a day earlier by american soldiers, he remembers their rage at what they saw sep and even if he lives to be a very old man, he will always be grateful to them for that rage, and also for their compassion sep though he did not understand their language, their eyes told him what he needed to know -- that they, too, would remember, and bear witness sep and now, i stand before you, mr sep president -- commander-in-chief of the army that freed me, and tens of thousands of others -- and i am filled with a profound and abiding gratitude to the american people sep "gratitude" is a word that i cherish sep gratitude is what defines the humanity of the human being sep and i am grateful to you, hillary, or mrs sep clinton, for what you said, and for what you are doing for children in the world, for the homeless, for the victims of injustice, the victims of destiny and society sep and i thank all of you for being here sep we are on the threshold of a new century, a new millennium sep what will the legacy of this vanishing century be sep how will it be remembered in the new millennium sep surely it will be judged, and judged severely, in both moral and metaphysical terms sep these failures have cast a dark shadow over humanity: two world wars, countless civil wars, the senseless chain of assassinations (gandhi, the kennedys, martin luther king, sadat, rabin), bloodbaths in cambodia and algeria, india and pakistan, ireland and rwanda, eritrea and ethiopia, sarajevo and kosovo; the inhumanity in the gulag and the tragedy of hiroshima sep and, on a different level, of course, auschwitz and treblinka sep so much violence; so much indifference sep what is indifference sep etymologically, the word means "no difference sep " a strange and unnatural state in which the lines blur between light and darkness, dusk and dawn, crime and punishment, cruelty and compassion, good and evil sep what are its courses and inescapable consequences sep is it a philosophy sep is there a philosophy of indifference conceivable sep can one possibly view indifference as a virtue sep is it necessary at times to practice it simply to keep one's sanity, live normally, enjoy a fine meal and a glass of wine, as the world around us experiences harrowing upheavals sep of course, indifference can be tempting -- more than that, seductive sep it is so much easier to look away from victims sep it is so much easier to avoid such rude interruptions to our work, our dreams, our hopes sep it is, after all, awkward, troublesome, to be involved in another person's pain and despair sep yet, for the person who is indifferent, his or her neighbor are of no consequence sep and, therefore, their lives are meaningless sep their hidden or even visible anguish is of no interest sep indifference reduces the other to an abstraction sep over there, behind the black gates of auschwitz, the most tragic of all prisoners were the "muselmanner," as they were called sep wrapped in their torn blankets, they would sit or lie on the ground, staring vacantly into space, unaware of who or where they were -- strangers to their surroundings sep they no longer felt pain, hunger, thirst sep they feared nothing sep they felt nothing sep they were dead and did not know it sep rooted in our tradition, some of us felt that to be abandoned by humanity then was not the ultimate sep we felt that to be abandoned by god was worse than to be punished by him sep better an unjust god than an indifferent one sep for us to be ignored by god was a harsher punishment than to be a victim of his anger sep man can live far from god -- not outside god sep god is wherever we are sep even in suffering sep even in suffering sep in a way, to be indifferent to that suffering is what makes the human being inhuman sep indifference, after all, is more dangerous than anger and hatred sep anger can at times be creative sep one writes a great poem, a great symphony sep one does something special for the sake of humanity because one is angry at the injustice that one witnesses sep but indifference is never creative sep even hatred at times may elicit a response sep you fight it sep you denounce it sep you disarm it sep indifference elicits no response sep indifference is not a response sep indifference is not a beginning; it is an end sep and, therefore, indifference is always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the aggressor -- never his victim, whose pain is magnified when he or she feels forgotten sep the political prisoner in his cell, the hungry children, the homeless refugees -- not to respond to their plight, not to relieve their solitude by offering them a spark of hope is to exile them from human memory sep and in denying their humanity, we betray our own sep indifference, then, is not only a sin, it is a punishment sep and this is one of the most important lessons of this outgoing century's wide-ranging experiments in good and evil sep in the place that i come from, society was composed of three simple categories: the killers, the victims, and the bystanders sep during the darkest of times, inside the ghettoes and death camps -- and i'm glad that mrs sep clinton mentioned that we are now commemorating that event, that period, that we are now in the days of remembrance -- but then, we felt abandoned, forgotten sep all of us did sep and our only miserable consolation was that we believed that auschwitz and treblinka were closely guarded secrets; that the leaders of the free world did not know what was going on behind those black gates and barbed wire; that they had no knowledge of the war against the jews that hitler's armies and their accomplices waged as part of the war against the allies sep if they knew, we thought, surely those leaders would have moved heaven and earth to intervene sep they would have spoken out with great outrage and conviction sep they would have bombed the railways leading to birkenau, just the railways, just once sep and now we knew, we learned, we discovered that the pentagon knew, the state department knew sep and the illustrious occupant of the white house then, who was a great leader -- and i say it with some anguish and pain, because, today is exactly 54 years marking his death -- franklin delano roosevelt died on april the 12th, 1945 sep so he is very much present to me and to us sep no doubt, he was a great leader sep he mobilized the american people and the world, going into battle, bringing hundreds and thousands of valiant and brave soldiers in america to fight fascism, to fight dictatorship, to fight hitler sep and so many of the young people fell in battle sep and, nevertheless, his image in jewish history -- i must say it -- his image in jewish history is flawed sep the depressing tale of the st sep louis is a case in point sep sixty years ago, its human cargo -- nearly 1,000 jews -- was turned back to nazi germany sep and that happened after the kristallnacht, after the first state sponsored pogrom, with hundreds of jewish shops destroyed, synagogues burned, thousands of people put in concentration camps sep and that ship, which was already in the shores of the united states, was sent back sep i don't understand sep roosevelt was a good man, with a heart sep he understood those who needed help sep why didn't he allow these refugees to disembark sep a thousand people -- in america, the great country, the greatest democracy, the most generous of all new nations in modern history sep what happened sep i don't understand sep why the indifference, on the highest level, to the suffering of the victims sep but then, there were human beings who were sensitive to our tragedy sep those non-jews, those christians, that we call the "righteous gentiles," whose selfless acts of heroism saved the honor of their faith sep why were they so few sep why was there a greater effort to save ss murderers after the war than to save their victims during the war sep why did some of america's largest corporations continue to do business with hitler's germany until 1942 sep it has been suggested, and it was documented, that the wehrmacht could not have conducted its invasion of france without oil obtained from american sources sep how is one to explain their indifference sep and yet, my friends, good things have also happened in this traumatic century: the defeat of nazism, the collapse of communism, the rebirth of israel on its ancestral soil, the demise of apartheid, israel's peace treaty with egypt, the peace accord in ireland sep and let us remember the meeting, filled with drama and emotion, between rabin and arafat that you, mr sep president, convened in this very place sep i was here and i will never forget it sep and then, of course, the joint decision of the united states and nato to intervene in kosovo and save those victims, those refugees, those who were uprooted by a man, whom i believe that because of his crimes, should be charged with crimes against humanity sep but this time, the world was not silent sep this time, we do respond sep this time, we intervene sep does it mean that we have learned from the past sep does it mean that society has changed sep has the human being become less indifferent and more human sep have we really learned from our experiences sep are we less insensitive to the plight of victims of ethnic cleansing and other forms of injustices in places near and far sep is today's justified intervention in kosovo, led by you, mr sep president, a lasting warning that never again will the deportation, the terrorization of children and their parents, be allowed anywhere in the world sep will it discourage other dictators in other lands to do the same sep what about the children sep oh, we see them on television, we read about them in the papers, and we do so with a broken heart sep their fate is always the most tragic, inevitably sep when adults wage war, children perish sep we see their faces, their eyes sep do we hear their pleas sep do we feel their pain, their agony sep every minute one of them dies of disease, violence, famine sep some of them -- so many of them -- could be saved sep and so, once again, i think of the young jewish boy from the carpathian mountains sep he has accompanied the old man i have become throughout these years of quest and struggle sep and together we walk towards the new millennium, carried by profound fear and extraordinary hope
ESFJ	*ladies and gentlemen: i have come to a decision which i felt i should tell you and all of my fellow american citizens, as soon as i was certain in my own mind and in my own conscience that it is the right thing to do sep *i have learned already in this office that the difficult decisions always come to this desk sep i must admit that many of them do not look at all the same as the hypothetical questions that i have answered freely and perhaps too fast on previous occasions sep my customary policy is to try and get all the facts and to consider the opinions of my countrymen and to take counsel with my most valued friends sep but these seldom agree, and in the end, the decision is mine sep to procrastinate, to agonize, and to wait for a more favorable turn of events that may never come or more compelling external pressures that may as well be wrong as right, is itself a decision of sorts and a weak and potentially dangerous course for a president to follow sep i have promised to uphold the constitution, to do what is right as god gives me to see the right, and to do the very best that i can for america sep i have asked your help and your prayers, not only when i became president but many times since sep the constitution is the supreme law of our land, and it governs our actions as citizens sep only the laws of god, which govern our consciences, are superior to it sep as we are a nation under god, so i am sworn to uphold our laws with the help of god sep and i have sought such guidance and searched my own conscience with special diligence to determine the right thing for me to do with respect to my predecessor in this place, richard nixon, and his loyal wife and family sep theirs is an american tragedy in which we all -- all have played a part sep it could go on and on and on, or someone must write the end to it sep i have concluded that only i can do that, and if i can, i must sep there are no historic or legal precedents to which i can turn in this matter, none that precisely fit the circumstances of a private citizen who has resigned the presidency of the united states sep but it is common knowledge that serious allegations and accusations hang like a sword over our former president's head, threatening his health as he tries to reshape his life, a great part of which was spent in the service of this country and by the mandate of its people sep after years of bitter controversy and divisive national debate, i have been advised, and i am compelled to conclude that many months and perhaps more years will have to pass before richard nixon could obtain a fair trial by jury in any jurisdiction of the united states under governing decisions of the supreme court sep i deeply believe in equal justice for all americans, whatever their station or former station sep the law, whether human or divine, is no respecter of persons; but the law is a respecter of reality sep the facts, as i see them, are that a former president of the united states, instead of enjoying equal treatment with any other citizen accused of violating the law, would be cruelly and excessively penalized either in preserving the presumption of his innocence or in obtaining a speedy determination of his guilt in order to repay a legal debt to society sep during this long period of delay and potential litigation, ugly passions would again be aroused sep and our people would again be polarized in their opinions sep and the credibility of our free institutions of government would again be challenged at home and abroad sep in the end, the courts might well hold that richard nixon had been denied due process, and the verdict of history would even more be inconclusive with respect to those charges arising out of the period of his presidency, of which i am presently aware sep but it is not the ultimate fate of richard nixon that most concerns me, though surely it deeply troubles every decent and every compassionate person sep my concern is the immediate future of this great country sep in this, i dare not depend upon my personal sympathy as a long-time friend of the former president, nor my professional judgment as a lawyer, and i do not sep as president, my primary concern must always be the greatest good of all the people of the united states whose servant i am sep as a man, my first consideration is to be true to my own convictions and my own conscience sep my conscience tells me clearly and certainly that i cannot prolong the bad dreams that continue to reopen a chapter that is closed sep my conscience tells me that only i, as president, have the constitutional power to firmly shut and seal this book sep my conscience tells me it is my duty, not merely to proclaim domestic tranquility but to use every means that i have to insure it sep i do believe that the buck stops here, that i cannot rely upon public opinion polls to tell me what is right sep i do believe that right makes might and that if i am wrong, 10 angels swearing i was right would make no difference sep i do believe, with all my heart and mind and spirit, that i, not as president but as a humble servant of god, will receive justice without mercy if i fail to show mercy sep finally, i feel that richard nixon and his loved ones have suffered enough and will continue to suffer, no matter what i do, no matter what we, as a great and good nation, can do together to make his goal of peace come true sep now, therefore, i, gerald r sep ford, president of the united states, pursuant to the pardon power conferred upon me by article ii, section 2, of the constitution, have granted and by these presents do grant a full, free, and absolute pardon unto richard nixon for all offenses against the united states which he, richard nixon, has committed or may have committed or taken part in during the period from july 20, 1969 through august 9, 1974 sep *in witness whereof, i have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of september, in the year of our lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four, and of the independence of the united states of america the one hundred and ninety-ninth sep *
INTJ	it gives me pleasure to add to this formal reading of the result of our labors that the character of the discussion which occurred at the sittings of the commission was not only of the most constructive but of the most encouraging sort sep it was obvious throughout our discussions that, although there were subjects upon which there were individual differences of judgment with regard to the method by which our objects should be obtained, there was practically at no point any serious differences of opinion or motive as to the objects which we were seeking sep indeed, while these debates were not made the opportunity for the expression of enthusiasm and sentiments, i think the other members of the commission will agree with me that there was an undertone of high respect and of enthusiasm for the thing we were trying to do which was heartening throughout everything sep because we felt that in a way this conference did entrust into us the expression of one of its highest and most important purposes, to see to it that the concord of the world in the future with regard to the objects of justice should not be subject to doubt or uncertainty; that the cooperation of the great body of nations should be assured in the maintenance of peace upon terms of honor and of international obligations sep the compulsion of that task was constantly upon us, and at no point was there shown the slightest desire to do anything but suggest the best means to accomplish that great object sep there is very great significance, therefore, in the fact that the result was reached unanimously sep fourteen nations were represented, among them all of those powers which for convenience we have called the great powers, and among the rest a representation of the greatest variety of circumstances and interests sep so that i think we are justified in saying that the significance of the result, therefore, has the deepest of all meanings, the union of wills in a common purpose, a union of wills which cannot be resisted and which, i dare say, no nation will run the risk of attempting to resist sep now, as to the character of the document sep while it has consumed some time to read this document, i think you will see at once that it is very simple, and in nothing so simple as in the structure which it suggests for a league of nations, a body of delegates, an executive council, and a permanent secretariat sep when it came to the question of determining the character of the representation in the body of delegates, we were all aware of a feeling which is current throughout the world sep inasmuch as i am stating it in the presence of the official representatives of the various governments here present, including myself, i may say that there is a universal feeling that the world cannot rest satisfied with merely official guidance sep there has reached us through many channels the feeling that if the deliberating body of the league of nations was merely to be a body of officials representing the various governments, the peoples of the world would not be sure that some of the mistakes which preoccupied officials had admittedly made might not be repeated sep it was impossible to conceive a method or an assembly so large and various as to be really representative of the great body of the peoples of the world, because, as i roughly reckon it, we represent as we sit around this table more than 1 sep 2 billion people sep you cannot have a representative assembly of 1 sep 2 billion people, but if you leave it to each government to have, if it pleases, one or two or three representatives, though only with a single vote, it may vary its representation from time to time, not only, but it may (originate) the choice of its several representatives [wireless here unintelligible sep therefore we thought that this was a proper and a very prudent concession to the practically universal opinion of plain men everywhere that they wanted the door left open to a variety of representation, instead of being confined to a single official body with which they could or might not find themselves in sympathy sep and you will notice that this body has unlimited rights of discussion sep i mean of discussion of anything that falls within the field of international relations -- and that it is especially agreed that war or international misunderstandings or anything that may lead to friction or trouble is everybody's business, because it may affect the peace of the world sep and in order to safeguard the popular power so far as we could of this representative body, it is provided, you will notice, that when a subject is submitted it is not to arbitration but to discussion by the executive council; it can, upon the initiative of either of the parties to the dispute, be drawn out of the executive council on the larger form of the general body of delegates, because through this instrument we are depending primarily and chiefly upon one great force, and this is the moral force of the public opinion of the world -- the pleasing and clarifying and compelling influences of publicity -- so that intrigues can no longer have their coverts; so that designs that are sinister can at anytime be drawn into the open, so that those things that are destroyed by the light may be promptly destroyed by the overwhelming light of the universal expression of the condemnation of the world sep armed force is in the background in this program; but it is in the background, and, if the moral force of the world will not suffice, the physical force of the world shall sep but that is the last resort, because this is intended as a constitution of peace, not as a league of war sep the simplicity of the document seems to me to be one of its chief virtues, because, speaking for myself, i was unable to see the variety of circumstances with which this league would have to deal sep i was unable, therefore, to plan all the machinery that might be necessary to meet the differing and unexpected contingencies sep therefore, i should say of this document that it is not a straitjacket but a vehicle of life sep a living thing is born, and we must see to it what clothes we put on it sep it is not a vehicle of power, but a vehicle in which power may be varied at the discretion of those who exercise it and in accordance with the changing circumstances of the time sep and yet, while it is elastic, while it is general in its terms, it is definite in the one thing that we were called upon to make definite sep it is a definite guaranty of peace sep it is a definite guaranty by word against aggression sep it is a definite guaranty against the things which have just come near bringing the whole structure of civilization into ruin sep its purposes do not for a moment lie vague sep its purposes are declared, and its powers are unmistakable sep it is not in contemplation that this should be merely a league to secure the peace of the world sep it is a league which can be used for cooperation in any international matter sep that is the significance of the provision introduced concerning labor sep there are many ameliorations of labor conditions which can be effected by conference and discussion sep i anticipate that there will be a very great usefulness in the bureau of labor which it is contemplated shall be set up by the league sep men and women and children who work have been in the background through long ages and sometimes seemed to be forgotten, while governments have had their watchful and suspicious eyes upon the maneuvers of one another, while the thought of statesmen has been about structural action and the larger transactions of commerce and of finance sep now, if i may believe the picture which i see, there comes into the foreground the great body of the laboring people of the world, the men and women and children upon whom the great burden of sustaining the world must from day to day fall, whether we wish it to do so or not; people who go to bed tired and wake up without the stimulation of lively hope sep these people will be drawn into the field of international consultation and help, and will be among the wards of the combined governments of the world sep this is, i take leave to say, a very great step in advance in the mere conception of that sep then, as you will notice, there is an imperative article concerning the publicity of all international agreements sep henceforth no member of the league can call any agreement valid which it has not registered with the secretary general, in whose office, of course, it will be subject to the examination of any body representing a member of the league sep and the duty is laid upon the secretary general to earliest possible time sep i suppose most persons who have not been conversant with the business of foreign affairs do not realize how many hundreds of these agreements are made in a single year, and how difficult it might be to publish the more unimportant of them immediately sep how uninteresting it would be to most of the world to publish them immediately, but even they must be published just as soon as it is possible for the secretary general to publish them sep there has been no greater advance than this, gentlemen sep if you look back upon the history of the world you will see how helpless peoples have too often been a prey to powers that had no conscience in the matter sep it has been one of the many distressing revelations of recent years that the great power which has just been, happily, defeated put intolerable burdens and injustices upon the helpless people of some of the colonies which it annexed to itself; that its interest was rather their extermination than their development; that the desire was to possess their land for european purposes, and not to enjoy their confidence in order that mankind might be lifted in these places to the next higher level sep now, the world, expressing its conscience in law, says there is an end of that, that our consciences shall be settled to this thing sep states will be picked out which have already shown that they can exercise a conscience in this matter, and under their tutelage the helpless peoples of the world will come into a new light and into a new hope
ESTJ	mr sep speaker, mr sep president, members of the house, members of the senate, my fellow americans: all i have i would have given gladly not to be standing here today sep the greatest leader of our time has been struck down by the foulest deed of our time sep today, john fitzgerald kennedy lives on in the immortal words and works that he left behind sep he lives on in the mind and memories of mankind sep he lives on in the hearts of his countrymen sep no words are sad enough to express our sense of loss sep no words are strong enough to express our determination to continue the forward thrust of america that he began sep the dream of conquering the vastness of space, the dream of partnership across the atlantic -- and across the pacific as well -- the dream of a peace corps in less developed nations, the dream of education for all of our children, the dream of jobs for all who seek them and need them, the dream of care for our elderly, the dream of an all-out attack on mental illness, and above all, the dream of equal rights for all americans, whatever their race or color sep these and other american dreams have been vitalized by his drive and by his dedication sep and now the ideas and the ideals which he so nobly represented must and will be translated into effective action sep under john kennedy's leadership, this nation has demonstrated that it has the courage to seek peace, and it has the fortitude to risk war sep we have proved that we are a good and reliable friend to those who seek peace and freedom sep we have shown that we can also be a formidable foe to those who reject the path of peace and those who seek to impose upon us or our allies the yoke of tyranny sep this nation will keep its commitments from south vietnam to west berlin sep we will be unceasing in the search for peace, resourceful in our pursuit of areas of agreement -- even with those with whom we differ -- and generous and loyal to those who join with us in common cause sep in this age when there can be no losers in peace and no victors in war, we must recognize the obligation to match national strength with national restraint sep we must be prepared at one and the same time for both the confrontation of power and the limitation of power sep we must be ready to defend the national interest and to negotiate the common interest sep this is the path that we shall continue to pursue sep those who test our courage will find it strong, and those who seek our friendship will find it honorable sep we will demonstrate anew that the strong can be just in the use of strength, and the just can be strong in the defense of justice sep and let all know we will extend no special privilege and impose no persecution sep we will carry on the fight against poverty, and misery, and disease, and ignorance, in other lands and in our own sep we will serve all the nation, not one section or one sector, or one group, but all americans sep these are the united states: a united people with a united purpose sep our american unity does not depend upon unanimity sep we have differences; but now, as in the past, we can derive from those differences strength, not weakness, wisdom, not despair sep both as a people and a government, we can unite upon a program, a program which is wise and just, enlightened and constructive sep for 32 years capitol hill has been my home sep i have shared many moments of pride with you, pride in the ability of the congress of the united states to act, to meet any crisis, to distill from our differences strong programs of national action sep an assassin's bullet has thrust upon me the awesome burden of the presidency sep i am here today to say i need your help sep i cannot bear this burden alone sep i need the help of all americans, and all america sep this nation has experienced a profound shock, and in this critical moment, it is our duty, yours and mine, as the government of the united states, to do away with uncertainty and doubt and delay, and to show that we are capable of decisive action; that from the brutal loss of our leader we will derive not weakness, but strength; that we can and will act and act now sep from this chamber of representative government, let all the world know and none misunderstand that i rededicate this government to the unswerving support of the united nations, to the honorable and determined execution of our commitments to our allies, to the maintenance of military strength second to none, to the defense of the strength and the stability of the dollar, to the expansion of our foreign trade, to the reinforcement of our programs of mutual assistance and cooperation in asia and africa, and to our alliance for progress in this hemisphere sep on the 20th day of january, in 19 and 61, john f sep kennedy told his countrymen that our national work would not be finished "in the first thousand days, nor in the life of this administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet sep " "but," he said, "let us begin sep "today in this moment of new resolve, i would say to all my fellow americans, let us continue sep this is our challenge -- not to hesitate, not to pause, not to turn about and linger over this evil moment, but to continue on our course so that we may fulfill the destiny that history has set for us sep our most immediate tasks are here on this hill sep first, no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedy's memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long sep we have talked long enough in this country about equal rights sep we have talked for a hundred years or more sep it is time now to write the next chapter, and to write it in the books of law sep i urge you again, as i did in 19 and 57 and again in 19 and 60, to enact a civil rights law so that we can move forward to eliminate from this nation every trace of discrimination and oppression that is based upon race or color sep there could be no greater source of strength to this nation both at home and abroad sep and second, no act of ours could more fittingly continue the work of president kennedy than the early passage of the tax bill for which he fought all this long year sep this is a bill designed to increase our national income and federal revenues, and to provide insurance against recession sep that bill, if passed without delay, means more security for those now working, more jobs for those now without them, and more incentive for our economy sep in short, this is no time for delay sep it is a time for action -- strong, forward-looking action on the pending education bills to help bring the light of learning to every home and hamlet in america; strong, forward-looking action on youth employment opportunities; strong, forward-looking action on the pending foreign aid bill, making clear that we are not forfeiting our responsibilities to this hemisphere or to the world, nor erasing executive flexibility in the conduct of our foreign affairs; and strong, prompt, and forward-looking action on the remaining appropriation bills sep in this new spirit of action, the congress can expect the full cooperation and support of the executive branch sep and, in particular, i pledge that the expenditures of your government will be administered with the utmost thrift and frugality sep i will insist that the government get a dollar's value for a dollar spent sep the government will set an example of prudence and economy sep this does not mean that we will not meet our unfilled needs or that we will not honor our commitments sep we will do both sep as one who has long served in both houses of the congress, i firmly believe in the independence and the integrity of the legislative branch sep and i promise you that i shall always respect this sep it is deep in the marrow of my bones sep with equal firmness, i believe in the capacity and i believe in the ability of the congress, despite the divisions of opinions which characterize our nation, to act -- to act wisely, to act vigorously, to act speedily when the need arises sep the need is here sep the need is now sep i ask your help sep we meet in grief, but let us also meet in renewed dedication and renewed vigor sep let us meet in action, in tolerance, and in mutual understanding sep john kennedy's death commands what his life conveyed -- that america must move forward sep the time has come for americans of all races and creeds and political beliefs to understand and to respect one another sep so let us put an end to the teaching and the preaching of hate and evil and violence sep let us turn away from the fanatics of the far left and the far right, from the apostles of bitterness and bigotry, from those defiant of law, and those who pour venom into our nation's bloodstream sep i profoundly hope that the tragedy and the torment of these terrible days will bind us together in new fellowship, making us one people in our hour of sorrow sep so let us here highly resolve that john fitzgerald kennedy did not live or die in vain sep and on this thanksgiving eve, as we gather together to ask the lord's blessing, and give him our thanks, let us unite in those familiar and cherished words: america, america,god shed his grace on thee,and crown thy goodwith brotherhoodfrom sea to shining sea
INFJ	mr sep president, fellow delegates: the long and meticulous study and debate of which this universal declaration of human rights is the product means that it reflects the composite views of the many men and governments who have contributed to its formulation sep not every man nor every government can have what he wants in a document of this kind sep there are of course particular provisions in the declaration before us with which we are not fully satisfied sep i have no doubt this is true of other delegations, and it would still be true if we continued our labors over many years sep taken as a whole the delegation of the united states believes that this is a good document -- even a great document -- and we propose to give it our full support sep the position of the united states on the various parts of the declaration is a matter of record in the third committee sep i shall not burden the assembly, and particularly my colleagues of the third committee, with a restatement of that position here sep i should like to comment briefly on the amendments proposed by the soviet delegation sep the language of these amendments has been dressed up somewhat, but the substance is the same as the amendments which were offered by the soviet delegation in committee and rejected after exhaustive discussion sep substantially the same amendments have been previously considered and rejected in the human rights commission sep we in the united states admire those who fight for their convictions, and the soviet delegation has fought for their convictions sep but in the older democracies we have learned that sometimes we bow to the will of the majority sep in doing that, we do not give up our convictions sep we continue sometimes to persuade, and eventually we may be successful sep but we know that we have to work together and we have to progress sep so, we believe that when we have made a good fight, and the majority is against us, it is perhaps better tactics to try to cooperate sep i feel bound to say that i think perhaps it is somewhat of an imposition on this assembly to have these amendments offered again here, and i am confident that they will be rejected without debate sep the first two paragraphs of the amendment to article 3 deal with the question of minorities, which committee 3 decided required further study, and has recommended, in a separate resolution, their reference to the economic and social council and the human rights commission sep as set out in the soviet amendment, this provision clearly states "group," and not "individual," rights sep the soviet amendment to article 20 is obviously a very restrictive statement of the right to freedom of opinion and expression sep it sets up standards which would enable any state practically to deny all freedom of opinion and expression without violating the article sep it introduces the terms "democratic view," "democratic systems," "democratic state," and "fascism," which we know all too well from debates in this assembly over the past two years on warmongering and related subjects are liable to the most flagrant abuse and diverse interpretations sep the statement of the soviet delegate here tonight is a very good case in point on this sep the soviet amendment of article 22 introduces new elements into the article without improving the committed text and again introduces specific reference to "discrimination sep " as was repeatedly pointed out in committee 3, the question of discrimination is comprehensively covered in article 2 of the declaration, so that its restatement elsewhere is completely unnecessary and also has the effect of weakening the comprehensive principles stated in article 2 sep the new article proposed by the soviet delegation is but a restatement of state obligation, which the soviet delegation attempted to introduce into practically every article in the declaration sep it would convert the declaration into a document stating obligations on states, thereby changing completely its character as a statement of principles to serve as a common standard of achievement for the members of the united nations sep the soviet proposal for deferring consideration of the declaration to the 4th session of the assembly requires no comment sep an identical text was rejected in committee 3 by a vote of 6 in favor and 26 against sep we are all agreed, i am sure, that the declaration, which has been worked on with such great effort and devotion, and over such a long period of time, must be approved by this assembly at this session sep certain provisions of the declaration are stated in such broad terms as to be acceptable only because of the provisions in article 30 providing for limitation on the exercise of the rights for the purpose of meeting the requirements of morality, public order, and the general welfare sep an example of this is the provision that everyone has the right to equal access to the public service in his country sep the basic principle of equality and of nondiscrimination as to public employment is sound, but it cannot be accepted without limitation sep my government, for example, would consider that this is unquestionably subject to limitation in the interest of public order and the general welfare sep it would not consider that the exclusion from public employment of persons holding subversive political beliefs and not loyal to the basic principles and practices of the constitution and laws of the country would in any way infringe upon this right sep likewise, my government has made it clear in the course of the development of the declaration that it does not consider that the economic and social and cultural rights stated in the declaration imply an obligation on governments to assure the enjoyment of these rights by direct governmental action sep this was made quite clear in the human rights commission text of article 23 which served as a so-called "umbrella" article to the articles on economic and social rights sep we consider that the principle has not been affected by the fact that this article no longer contains a reference to the articles which follow it sep this in no way affects our whole-hearted support for the basic principles of economic, social, and cultural rights set forth in these articles sep in giving our approval to the declaration today it is of primary importance that we keep clearly in mind the basic character of the document sep it is not a treaty; it is not an international agreement sep it is not and does not purport to be a statement of law or of legal obligation sep it is a declaration of basic principles of human rights and freedoms, to be stamped with the approval of the general assembly by formal vote of its members, and to serve as a common standard of achievement for all peoples of all nations sep we stand today at the threshold of a great event both in the life of the united nations and in the life of mankind sep this universal declaration of human rights may well become the international magna carta of all men everywhere sep we hope its proclamation by the general assembly will be an event comparable to the proclamation of the declaration of the rights of man by the french people in 1789, the adoption of the bill of rights by the people of the united states, and the adoption of comparable declarations at different times in other countries sep at a time when there are so many issues on which we find it difficult to reach a common basis of agreement, it is a significant fact that 58 states have found such a large measure of agreement in the complex field of human rights sep this must be taken as testimony of our common aspiration first voiced in the charter of the united nations to lift men everywhere to a higher standard of life and to a greater enjoyment of freedom sep mans desire for peace lies behind this declaration sep the realization that the flagrant violation of human rights by nazi and fascist countries sowed the seeds of the last world war has supplied the impetus for the work which brings us to the moment of achievement here today sep in a recent speech in canada, gladstone murray said: the central fact is that man is fundamentally a moral being, that the light we have is imperfect does not matter so long as we are always trying to improve it & we are equal in sharing the moral freedom that distinguishes us as men sep mans status makes each individual an end in himself sep no man is by nature simply the servant of the state or of another man & the ideal and fact of freedom -- and not technology -- are the true distinguishing marks of our civilization sep this declaration is based upon the spiritual fact that man must have freedom in which to develop his full stature and through common effort to raise the level of human dignity sep we have much to do to fully achieve and to assure the rights set forth in this declaration sep but having them put before us with the moral backing of 58 nations will be a great step forward sep as we here bring to fruition our labors on this declaration of human rights, we must at the same time rededicate ourselves to the unfinished task which lies before us sep we can now move on with new courage and inspiration to the completion of an international covenant on human rights and of measures for the implementation of human rights sep in conclusion, i feel that i cannot do better than to repeat the call to action by secretary marshall in his opening statement to this assembly: let this third regular session of the general assembly approve by an overwhelming majority the declaration of human right
ENFJ	mr sep chancellor, mr sep vice chancellor, professor robertson, mr sep diamond, mr sep daniel, and ladies and gentlemen: i come here this evening because of my deep interest and affection for a land settled by the dutch in the mid-seventeenth century, then taken over by the british, and at last independent; a land in which the native inhabitants were at first subdued, but relations with whom remain a problem to this day; a land which defined itself on a hostile frontier; a land which has tamed rich natural resources through the energetic application of modern technology; a land which once the importer of slaves, and now must struggle to wipe out the last traces of that former bondage sep i refer, of course, to the united states of america sep but i am glad to come here -- and my wife and i and all of our party are glad to come here to south africa, and we're glad to come to cape town sep i am already greatly enjoying my stay and my visit here sep i am making an effort to meet and exchange views with people of all walks of life, and all segments of south african opinion, including those who represent the views of the government sep today i am glad to meet with the national union of south african students sep for a decade, nusas has stood and worked for the principles of the universal declaration of human rights -- principles which embody the collective hopes of men of good will all around the globe sep your work at home and in international student affairs has brought great credit to yourselves and to your country sep i know the national student association in the united states feels a particularly close relationship with this organization sep and i wish to thank especially mr sep ian robertson, who first extended the invitation on behalf of nusas sep i wish to thank him for his kindness to me in inviting me sep i am very sorry that he can not be with us here this evening sep i was happy to have had the opportunity to meet and speak with him earlier this evening sep and i presented him with a copy of profiles in courage which was a book that was written by president john kennedy and was signed to him by president kennedy's widow, mrs sep john kennedy sep this is a day of affirmation, a celebration of liberty sep we stand here in the name of freedom sep at the heart of that western freedom and democracy is the belief that the individual man, the child of god, is the touchstone of value, and all society, all groups and states exist for that person's benefit sep therefore, the enlargement of liberty for individual human beings must be the supreme goal and the abiding practice of any western society sep the first element of this individual liberty is the freedom of speech: the right to express and communicate ideas, to set oneself apart from the dumb beasts of field and forest; the right to recall governments to their duties and to their obligations; above all, the right to affirm one's membership and allegiance to the body politic -- to society -- to the men with whom we share our land, our heritage, and our children's future sep hand in hand with freedom of speech goes the power to be heard, to share in the decisions of government which shape men's lives sep everything that makes man's life worthwhile -- family, work, education, a place to rear one's children and a place to rest one's head -- all this depends on the decisions of government; all can be swept away by a government which does not heed the demands of its people, and i mean all of its people sep therefore, the essential humanity of man can be protected and preserved only where government must answer -- not just to the wealthy, not just to those of a particular religion, not just to those of a particular race, but to all of the people sep and even government by the consent of the governed, as in our own constitution, must be limited in its power to act against its people, so that there may be no interference with the right to worship, but also no interference with the security of the home; no arbitrary imposition of pains or penalties on an ordinary citizen by officials high or low; no restriction on the freedom of men to seek education, or to seek work or opportunity of any kind, so that each man may become all that he is capable of becoming sep these -- these are the sacred rights of western society sep these were the essential differences between us and nazi germany, as they were between athens and persia sep they are the essence of our differences with communism today sep i am unalterably opposed to communism because it exalts the state over the individual and over the family; and because its system contains a lack of freedom of speech, of protest, of religion, and of the press, which is characteristic of a totalitarian regime sep the way of opposition to communism, however, is not to imitate its dictatorship, but to enlarge individual human freedoms sep there are those in every land who would label as communist every threat to their privilege sep but may i say to you as i have seen on my travels in all sections of the world, reform is not communism sep and the denial of freedom, in whatever name, only strengthens the very communism it claims to oppose sep many nations have set forth their own definitions and declarations of these principles sep and there have often been wide and tragic gaps between promise and performance, ideal and reality sep yet the great ideals have constantly recalled us to our own duties sep and with painful slowness, we in the united states have extended and enlarged the meaning and the practice of freedom to all of our people sep for two centuries, my own country has struggled to overcome the self-imposed handicap of prejudice and discrimination based on nationality, on social class or race -- discrimination profoundly repugnant to the theory and to the command of our constitution sep even as my father grew up in boston, massachusetts, signs told him: "no irish need apply sep " two generations later president kennedy became the first irish catholic, and the first catholic, to head the nation; but how many men of ability had, before 1961, been denied the opportunity to contribute to the nation's progress because they were catholic or because they were of irish extraction sep how many sons of italian or jewish or polish parents slumbered in the slums -- untaught, unlearned, their potential lost forever to our nation and to the human race sep even today, what price will we pay before we have assured full opportunity to millions of negro americans sep in the last five years we have done more to assure equality to our negro citizens, and to help the deprived both white and black, than in the hundred years before that time sep but much, much more remains to be done sep for there are millions of negroes untrained for the simplest of jobs, and thousands every day denied their full and equal rights under the law; and the violence of the disinherited, the insulted, the injured, looms over the streets of harlem and of watts and of the south side chicago sep but a negro american trains now as an astronaut, one of mankind's first explorers into outer space; another is the chief barrister of the united states government, and dozens sit on the benches of our court; and another, dr sep martin luther king, is the second man of african descent to win the nobel peace prize2 for his nonviolent efforts for social justice between all of the races sep we have passed laws prohibiting -- we have passed laws prohibiting discrimination in education, in employment, in housing, but these laws alone cannot overcome the heritage of centuries -- of broken families and stunted children, and poverty and degradation and pain sep so the road toward equality of freedom is not easy, and great cost and danger march alongside all of us sep we are committed to peaceful and nonviolent change, and that is important to all to understand -- though change is unsettling sep still, even in the turbulence of protest and struggle is greater hope for the future, as men learn to claim and achieve for themselves the rights formerly petitioned from others sep and most important of all, all of the panoply of government power has been committed to the goal of equality before the law, as we are now committing ourselves to the achievement of equal opportunity in fact sep we must recognize the full human equality of all of our people before god, before the law, and in the councils of government sep we must do this, not because it is economically advantageous, although it is; not because the laws of god command it, although they do; not because people in other lands wish it so sep we must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do sep we recognize that there are problems and obstacles before the fulfillment of these ideals in the united states, as we recognize that other nations, in latin america and in asia and in africa, have their own political, economic, and social problems, their unique barriers to the elimination of injustices sep in some, there is concern that change will submerge the rights of a minority, particularly where that minority is of a different race than that of the majority sep we in the united states believe in the protection of minorities; we recognize the contributions that they can make and the leadership that they can provide; and we do not believe that any people -- whether majority or minority, or individual human beings -- are "expendable" in the cause of theory or of policy sep we recognize also that justice between men and nations is imperfect, and the humanity sometimes progresses very slowly indeed sep all do not develop in the same manner and at the same pace sep nations, like men, often march to the beat of different drummers, and the precise solutions of the united states can neither be dictated nor transplanted to others -- and that is not our intention sep what is important, however, is that all nations must march toward increasing freedom, toward justice for all, toward a society strong and flexible enough to meet the demands of all of its people -- whatever their race -- and the demands that the world of immense and dizzying change that face us all sep in a few hours, the plane that brought me to this country crossed over oceans and countries which have been a crucible of human history sep in minutes we traced migrations of men over thousands of years; seconds, the briefest glimpse, and we passed battlefields on which millions of men once struggled and died sep we could see no national boundaries, no vast gulfs or high walls dividing people from people; only nature and the works of man -- homes and factories and farms -- everywhere reflecting man's common effort to enrich his life sep everywhere new technology and communications brings men and nations closer together, the concerns of one inevitably becomes the concerns of all sep and our new closeness is stripping away the false masks, the illusion of differences which is the root of injustice and of hate and of war sep only earthbound man still clings to the dark and poisoning superstition that his world is bounded by the nearest hill, his universe ends at river shore, his common humanity is enclosed in the tight circle of those who share his town or his views and the color of his skin sep it is -- it is your job, the task of young people in this world, to strip the last remnants of that ancient, cruel belief from the civilization of man sep each nation has different obstacles and different goals, shaped by the vagaries of history and of experience sep yet as i talk to young people around the world, i am impressed not by the diversity but by the closeness of their goals, their desires and their concerns and their hope for the future sep there is discrimination in new york, the racial inequality of apartheid in south africa, and serfdom in the mountains of peru sep people starve to death in the streets of india; a former prime minister is summarily executed in the congo; intellectuals go to jail in russia, and thousands are slaughtered in indonesia; wealth is lavished on armaments everywhere in the world sep these are different evils, but they are the common works of man sep they reflect the imperfections of human justice, the inadequacy of human compassion, the defectiveness of our sensibility toward the sufferings of our fellows; they mark the limit of our ability to use knowledge for the well-being of our fellow human beings throughout the world sep and therefore they call upon common qualities of conscience and indignation, a shared determination to wipe away the unnecessary sufferings of our fellow human beings at home and around the world sep it is these qualities which make of our youth today the only true international community sep more than this, i think that we could agree on what kind of a world we would all want to build sep it would be a world of independent nations, moving toward international community, each of which protected and respected the basic human freedoms sep it would be a world which demanded of each government that it accept its responsibility to insure social justice sep it would be a world of constantly accelerating economic progress -- not material welfare as an end in/of itself, but as a means to liberate the capacity of every human being to pursue his talents and to pursue his hopes sep it would, in short, be a world that we would all be proud to have built sep just to the north of here are lands of challenge and of opportunity, rich in natural resources -- land and minerals and people sep yet they are also lands confronted by the greatest odds -- overwhelming ignorance, internal tensions and strife, and great obstacles of climate and geography sep many of these nations, as colonies, were oppressed and were exploited sep yet they have not estranged themselves from the broad traditions of the west; they are hoping and they are gambling their progress and their stability on the chance that we will meet our responsibilities to them to help them overcome their poverty sep in the world we would like to build, south africa could play an outstanding role, and a role of leadership in that effort sep this country is without question a preeminent repository of the wealth and the knowledge and the skill of this continent sep here are the greater part of africa's research scientists and steel production, most of its reservoirs of coal and of electric power sep many south africans have made major contributions to african technical development and world science sep the names of some are known wherever men seek to eliminate the ravages of tropical disease and of pestilence sep in your faculties and councils, here in this very audience, are hundreds and thousands of men and women who could transform the lives of millions for all time to come sep but the help and the leadership of south africa or of the united states cannot be accepted if we, within our own country or in our relationships with others, deny individual integrity, human dignity, and the common humanity of man sep if we would lead outside our own borders, if we would help those who need our assistance, if we would meet our responsibilities to mankind, we must first, all of us, demolish the borders which history has erected between men within our own nations -- barriers of race and religion, social class and ignorance sep our answer is the world's hope: it is to rely on youth sep the cruelties and the obstacles of this swiftly changing planet will not yield to obsolete dogmas and outworn slogans sep it cannot be moved by those who cling to a present which is already dying, who prefer the illusion of security to the excitement and danger which comes with even the most peaceful progress sep this world demands the qualities of youth; not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of the imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the life of ease -- a man like the chancellor of this university sep it is a revolutionary world that we all live in, and thus, as i have said in latin america and in asia and in europe and in my own country, the united states, it is the young people who must take the lead sep thus, you, and your young compatriots everywhere, have had thrust upon you a greater burden of responsibility than any generation that has ever lived sep "there is," said an italian philosopher, "nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things sep "3 yet this is the measure of the task of your generation, and the road is strewn with many dangers sep first, is the danger of futility: the belief there is nothing one man or one woman can do against the enormous array of the world's ills -- against misery, against ignorance, or injustice and violence sep yet many of the world's great movements, of thought and action, have flowed from the work of a single man sep a young monk began the protestant reformation, a young general extended an empire from macedonia to the borders of the earth, and a young woman reclaimed the territory of france sep it was a young italian explorer who discovered the new world, and 32 year-old thomas jefferson who proclaimed that "all men are created equal sep ""give me a place to stand," said archimedes, "and i will move the world sep "4 these men moved the world, and so can we all sep few will have the greatness to bend history, but each of us can work to change a small portion of the events, and then the total -- all of these acts -- will be written in the history of this generation sep thousands of peace corps volunteers are making a difference in the isolated villages and the city slums of dozens of countries sep thousands of unknown men and women in europe resisted the occupation of the nazis and many died, but all added to the ultimate strength and freedom of their countries sep it is from numberless diverse acts of courage such as these that the belief that human history is thus shaped sep each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance sep "if athens shall appear great to you," said pericles, "consider then that her glories were purchased by valiant men, and by men who learned their duty sep "5 that is the source of all greatness in all societies, and it is the key to progress in our time sep the second danger is that of expediency: of those who say that hopes and beliefs must bend before immediate necessities sep of course, if we must act effectively we must deal with the world as it is sep we must get things done sep but if there was one thing that president kennedy stood for that touched the most profound feeling of young people around the world, it was the belief that idealism, high aspirations, and deep convictions are not incompatible with the most practical and efficient of programs -- that there is no basic inconsistency between ideals and realistic possibilities, no separation between the deepest desires of heart and of mind and the rational application of human effort to human problems sep it is not realistic or hardheaded to solve problems and take action unguided by ultimate moral aims and values, although we all know some who claim that it is so sep in my judgment, it is thoughtless folly sep for it ignores the realities of human faith and of passion and of belief -- forces ultimately more powerful than all of the calculations of our economists or of our generals sep of course to adhere to standards, to idealism, to vision in the face of immediate dangers takes great courage and takes self-confidence sep but we also know that only those who dare to fail greatly, can ever achieve greatly sep it is this new idealism which is also, i believe, the common heritage of a generation which has learned that while efficiency can lead to the camps at auschwitz, or the streets of budapest, only the ideals of humanity and love can climb the hills of the acropolis sep and a third danger is timidity sep few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of their society sep moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence sep yet it is the one essential, vital quality for those who seek to change the world -- which yields most painfully to change sep aristotle tells us: "at the olympic games it is not the finest or the strongest men who are crowned, but those who enter the lists sep " "so, too, in the life of the honorable and the good it is they who act rightly who win the prize sep "6 i believe that in this generation those with the courage to enter the conflict will find themselves with companions in every corner of the world sep for the fortunate amongst us, the fourth danger, my friends, is comfort, the temptation to follow the easy and familiar paths of personal ambition and financial success so grandly spread before those who have the privilege of an education sep but that is not the road history has marked out for us sep there is a chinese curse which says, "may he live in interesting times sep " like it or not we live in interesting times sep they are times of danger and uncertainty; but they are also the most creative of any time in the history of mankind sep and everyone here will ultimately be judged, will ultimately judge himself, on the effort he has contributed to building a new world society and the extent to which his ideals and goals have shaped that effort sep so we part, i to my country and you to remain sep we are, if a man of 40 can claim the privilege, fellow members of the world's largest younger generation sep each of us have our own work to do sep i know at times you must feel very alone with your problems and with your difficulties sep but i want to say how i -- impressed i am with the stand -- with what you stand for and for the effort that you are making; and i say this not just for myself, but men and women all over the world sep and i hope you will often take heart from the knowledge that you are joined with your fellow young people in every land, they struggling with their problems and you with yours, but all joined in a common purpose; that, like the young people of my own country and of every country that i have visited, you are all in many ways more closely united to the brothers of your time than to the older generations in any of these nations sep you're determined to build a better future sep president kennedy was speaking to the young people of america, but beyond them to young people everywhere, when he said: "the energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it; and the glow from that fire can truly light the world sep " and, he added, "with a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking his blessing and his help, but knowing that here on earth god's work must truly be our own sep "7i thank you
INFP	*thank you very much, senator fulbright, senator javits, senator symington, senator pell sep *i would like to say for the record that -- and also for the men behind me who are also wearing the uniform and their medals -- that my sitting up here is really symbolic sep i'm not here as john kerry sep i'm here as one member of a group of 1000, which is a small representation of a very much larger group of veterans in this country sep and were it possible for all of them to sit at this table, they would be here and have the same kind of testimony sep i would simply like to speak in very general terms sep i -- i apologize if my statement is general because i received notification yesterday you would hear me, and i'm afraid, because of the injunction, i was up most of the night and havent had a great deal of chance to prepare sep i would like to talk representing all those veterans and say that several months ago in detroit we had an investigation at which over 150 honorably discharged, and many very highly decorated, veterans testified to war crimes committed in southeast asia sep *these were* not isolated incidents but crimes committed on a day-to-day basis with the full awareness of officers at all levels of command sep it's impossible to describe to you exactly what did happen in detroit -- the emotions in the room and the feelings of the men who were reliving their experiences in vietnam sep but they did sep they relived the absolute horror of what this country, in a sense, made them do sep they told the stories of times that they had personally raped, cut off ears, cut off heads, taped wires from portable telephones to human genitals and turned up the power, cut off limbs, blown up bodies, randomly shot at civilians, razed villages in the fashion reminiscent of genghis khan, shot cattle and dogs for fun, pois"ned food stocks, and generally ravaged the countryside of south vietnam in addition to the normal ravage of war and the normal and very particular ravaging which is done by the applied bombing power of this country sep we call this investigation the "winter soldier investigation sep " the term winter soldier is a play on words of thomas paine's in 1776 when he spoke of the sunshine patriot and summertime soldiers who deserted at valley forge because the going was rough sep and we who have come here to washington have come here because we feel we have to be winter soldiers now sep we could come back to this country; and we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in vietnam sep but we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, not redcoats but the crimes which were committing are what threaten it; and we have to speak out sep i would like to talk to you a little bit about what the result is of -- of the feelings these men carry with them after coming back from vietnam sep the country doesnt know it yet but its created a monster, a monster in the form of millions of men who have been taught to deal and to trade in violence, and who are given the chance to die for the biggest nothing in history; men who have returned with a sense of anger and a sense of betrayal which no one has yet grasped sep as a veteran, and one who feels this anger, id like to talk about it sep were angry because we feel we have been used in the worst fashion by the administration of this country sep in 1970 at west point, vice president agnew said: some glamorize the criminal misfits of society while our best men die in asian rice paddies to preserve the freedoms which those misfits abuse sep and this was used as a rallying point for our effort in vietnam sep but for us, his boys in asia whom the country was supposed to support, his statement is a terrible distortion from which we can only draw a very deep sense of revulsion; and hence the anger of some of the men who are here in washington today sep its a distortion because we in no way considered ourselves the best men of this country; because those he calls misfits were standing up for us in a way that nobody else in this country dared to; because so many who have died would have returned to this country to join the misfits in their efforts to ask for an immediate withdrawal from south vietnam; because so many of those best men have returned as quadriplegics and amputees, and they lie forgotten in veterans administration hospitals in this country which fly the flag which so many have chosen as their own personal symbol sep and we cannot consider ourselves americas best men when we were ashamed of and hated what we were called to do in southeast asia sep in our opinion, and from our experience, there is nothing in south vietnam, nothing which could happen that realistically threatens the united states of america sep and to attempt to justify the loss of one american life in vietnam, cambodia, or laos by linking such loss to the preservation of freedom, which those misfits supposedly abuse, is to us the height of criminal hypocrisy, and its that kind of hypocrisy which we feel has torn this country apart sep we are probably much more angry than that and i dont want to go into the foreign policy aspects because im"classed here sep i know that all of you have talked about every possible -- every possible alternative to getting out of vietnam sep we understand that sep we know that youve considered the seriousness of the aspects to the utmost level and im not going to try and deal on that sep but i want to relate to you the feeling which many of the men whove returned to this country express because we are probably angriest about all that we were told about vietnam and about the mystical war against communism sep we found that not only was it a civil war, an effort by a people who had for years been seeking their liberation from any colonial influence whatsoever, but also we found that the vietnamese, whom we had enthusiastically molded after our own image, were hard put to take up the fight against the threat we were supposedly saving them from sep we found that most people didnt even know the difference between communism and democracy sep they only wanted to work in rice paddies without helicopters strafing them and bombs with napalm burning their villages and tearing their country apart sep they wanted everything to do with the war, particularly with this foreign presence of the united states of america, to leave them alone in peace; and they practiced the art of survival by siding with whichever military force was present at a particular time, be it vietcong, north vietna"ese, or american sep we found also that all too often american men were dying in those rice paddies for want of support from their allies sep we saw first hand how monies from american taxes was used for a corrupt dictatorial regime sep we saw that many people in this country had a one-sided idea of who was kept free by our flag, as blacks provided the highest percentage of casualties sep we saw vietnam ravaged equally by american bombs as well as by search and destroy missions, as well as by vietcong terrorism; and yet we listened while this country tried to blame all of the havoc on the vietcong sep we rationalized destroying villages in order to save them sep we saw america lose her sense of morality as she accepted very coolly a my lai and refused to give up the image of american soldiers that hand out chocolate bars and chewing gum sep we learned the meaning of "free-fire zones," "shoot anything that moves," and we watched while america placed a cheapness on the lives of orientals sep we watched the united states' falsification of body counts, in fact the glorification of body counts sep we listened while month after month we were told the back of the enemy was about to break sep we fought using weapons against oriental human beings, with quotation marks around that sep we fought using weapons against those people which i do not believe this country would dream of using were we fighting in a european theater -- or let us say a non-third-world people theater sep and so we watched while men charged up hills because a general said "at hill has to be taken sep " and after losing one platoon or two platoons they marched away to leave the hill for the reoccupation of the north vietnamese; because -- because we watched pride allow the most unimportant of battles to be blown into extravaganzas; because we couldnt lose, and we couldnt retreat, and because it didnt matter how many american bodies were lost to prove that point sep and so there were hamburger hills and khe sanhs and hill 881's and fire base 6's, and so many others sep and now were told that the men who fought there must watch quietly while american lives are lost so that we can exercise the incredible arrogance of vietnamizing the vietnamese sep each day -- each --committee chair (sen sep fulbright): i hope you wont interrupt [to audience who applauded mr sep kerry's immediately preceding remarks] sep hes making a very significant statement sep and let him proceed sep mr sep kerry: each day to facilitate the process by which the united states washes her hands of vietnam, someone has to give up his life so that united states doesnt have to admit something that the entire world already knows, so that we cannot say that weve made a mistake sep someone has to die so that president nixon wont be, and these are his words, the first [american] president to lose a war sep 2and we are asking americans to think about that because how do you ask a man to be the last man to die in vietnam sep how do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake sep but were trying to do that, and were doing it with thousands of rationalizations, and if you read carefully the presidents last speech to the people of this country, you can see that he says, and says clearly: but the issue, gentlemen, the issue is communism, and the question is whether or not we will leave that country to the communists or whether or not we will try to give it hope to be a free people sep 3but the point is theyre not a free people now -- under us sep theyre not a free people sep and we cannot fight communism all over the world, and i think we should have learnt that lesson by now sep but the problem of veterans goes beyond this personal problem, because you think about a poster in this country with a picture of uncle sam and the picture says i want you sep  and a young man comes out of high school and says, thats fine sep im going to serve my country sep  and he goes to vietnam and he shoots and he kills and he does his job or maybe he doesnt kill, maybe he just goes and he comes back sep when he gets back to this country he finds that he isnt really wanted, because the largest unemployment figure in the country -- it varies depending on who you get it from, the veterans administration 15 percent, various other sources 22 percent -- but the largest figure of unemployed in this country are veterans of this war sep and of those veterans 33 percent of the unemployed are black sep that means 1 out of every 10 of the nations unemployed is a veteran of vietnam sep the hospitals across the country wont or cant meet their demands sep its not a question of not trying sep they havent got the appropriations sep a man recently died after he had a tracheotomy in california, not because of the operation but because there werent enough personnel to clean the mucous out of his tube and he suffocated to death sep another young man just died in a new york va hospital the other day sep a friend of mine was ly
